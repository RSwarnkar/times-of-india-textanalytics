    "article_body": "NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has registered a case against Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) general counsel and designated US-based terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun for having instigated Sikh soldiers to prevent Prime Minister Narendra Modi from hoisting the Indian tricolour at Red Fort here on August 15, and offering them a Rs 11 crore reward to do so.The FIR registered by NIA cites credible information and video retrieved from SFJ US official X handle, on Aug 10, 2025, in which Pannun gave the call for stopping the PM Modi from hoisting the national flag. He also unveiled a map of Khalistan, envisioning Punjab, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh as its parts. Recalling his declaration that Shaheed Jatha of SFJ would fight against India, NIA said he had indulged in activities for disrupting sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of India and spread disaffection among Sikhs against India. It added that the Centre was of the opinion that a scheduled offence under the NIA Act had been committed and must be investigated.As per the FIR, information with the Central govt indicated that Pannun had hosted a meet the press at Lahore Press Club in Pakistan, on Aug 10, where he addressed journalists via video link from Washington, rejecting Indias sovereignty over Punjab and promoting the cause of Khalistan.During the press meet, he also unveiled SFJs new Delhi Banayga Khalistan referendum map which incorporates Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi into envisioned Khalistan, the FIR states.Pannun has been charged with offences under Section 61(2) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (criminal conspiracy) and Sections 10 and 13 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, 1967.",

        "People fail to realize that America's sovereign land serves as a safe haven for international separatist forces. In order to overthrow the Russian Soviet regime, which is responsible for the Twin Towers attack, the USA even created Osama bin Laden as a Frankenstein figure in Afghanistan. America is a paper tiger rather than a leader in promoting peace, as demonstrated by its problematic history in Vietnam, Iraq-Iran, Ukraine, Sudan, Syria war and other places. The question raised here is whether the US government is ignorant of Sikh separatist activity. &lt;br/&gt;If so, why not lead these subversive forces to back the Indian Republic, the world's largest democratic system? The White House's dual policy is clearly causing tensions between the two titans of the liberal establishment, the oldest and largest. Under the timetable of free and fair elections in front of international observers and international media, the Indian prime minister represents the 1.5 billion masses and has been the model for a peaceful handover of power. Therefore, if an outside force hosts separatists, it is a tried-and-true ally of the Indian Republic to hide them?",

        "Sikhs have defended India for hundreds of years. Their patriotism is second to none!. They will teach SfJ and its lead character who barks from his safe haven a lesson he will never forget.",
        "Why Sikh population doesn't speak out to denounce such activities?",
        "We take pride in our Sikh brothers acted as protectors, particularly defending the populace from the Mughal Empire's persecution and invasions from the northwest.  This Panun is not a true Sikh and has been planted by ISI. He should be ignored and not given any importance",

        "But Punjab people doesn't want what Pannun wants. Which dream is he living in?",
        "Let this Pannun come to India and talk anti-Indian statement then Modi will show him the right \"place\" to put him for ever &amp; will die in jail. Every dog has it's own day.",
