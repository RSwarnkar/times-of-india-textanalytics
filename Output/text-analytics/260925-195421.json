        "article_body": "NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has registered a case against Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) general counsel and designated US-based terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun for having instigated Sikh soldiers to prevent Prime Minister Narendra Modi from hoisting the Indian tricolour at Red Fort here on August 15, and offering them a Rs 11 crore reward to do so.The FIR registered by NIA cites credible information and video retrieved from SFJ US official X handle, on Aug 10, 2025, in which Pannun gave the call for stopping the PM Modi from hoisting the national flag. He also unveiled a map of Khalistan, envisioning Punjab, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh as its parts. Recalling his declaration that Shaheed Jatha of SFJ would fight against India, NIA said he had indulged in activities for disrupting sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of India and spread disaffection among Sikhs against India. It added that the Centre was of the opinion that a scheduled offence under the NIA Act had been committed and must be investigated.As per the FIR, information with the Central govt indicated that Pannun had hosted a meet the press at Lahore Press Club in Pakistan, on Aug 10, where he addressed journalists via video link from Washington, rejecting Indias sovereignty over Punjab and promoting the cause of Khalistan.During the press meet, he also unveiled SFJs new Delhi Banayga Khalistan referendum map which incorporates Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi into envisioned Khalistan, the FIR states.Pannun has been charged with offences under Section 61(2) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (criminal conspiracy) and Sections 10 and 13 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, 1967.",

Ladakh, once peaceful, is now gripped by frustration & insecurity due to Govts failed UT experiment. The onus lies on the Govtresume dialogue, act sensibly & fulfill Ladakhs demand for Statehood & Sixth Schedule without delay. Also I appeal people to remain peaceful and steadfast,\" Sajad Kargili, leader of Kargil Democratic Front wrote on XThe last round of talks between the committee and the joint leadership of LAB and KDA, both formed after the abrogation of Article 370, was held on May 27, leading to the introduction of a domicile policy in Ladakh.

        "article_body": "NEW DELHI: Activist Sonam Wangchuk on Wednesday called off his 15-day hunger strike demanding statehood for the Union Territory of Ladakh, following violent protests that broke out in the regions capital, Leh, news agency PTI reported.\"VERY SAD EVENTS IN LEH: My message of peaceful path failed today. I appeal to youth to please stop this nonsense. This only damages our cause,\" Wangchuk posted on X along with a video message.\"Friends, it is extremely sad that today, on day 15 of our protest, Leh witnessed violence on a massive scale. Yesterday, out of those who had been fasting for 35 days, two had to be hospitalised. This made people angry and a shutdown was called in Leh. Thousand of youngsters came on the streets,\" he said.He further called the protest a \"Gen Z revolution\" - using a term popularised by the recent youth-led demonstrations that toppled the government in Nepal.Wangchuk added, \"They have been unemployed for five years...I've been saying for years that keeping the youth unemployed and snatching their democratic rights leads to unrest. There are several issues but I will talk about them later. I urge the youngsters not to take the path of violence. This would render my efforts of five years useless.\".Stressing on the need to remain peaceful, he urged both sides to engage in dialogue.  \"I want the government to listen to the message of peace. When they ignore peaceful protests and marches, such situations arise. I would urge the government to be sensitive about Ladakh and urge the younger generation to follow the path of peace. This (violence) path is not my path. It is a result of their anger. But this is not the time to vent their anger. It is time to have a calm, cool conversation with the government,\" the activist said.Ladakh was earlier part of the erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir state. On August 5, 2019, the BJP-led central government revoked J&Ks statehood and reorganised it into a Union Territory. At the same time, Ladakh was also carved out as a separate Union Territory.",

Many offices and police vehicles were vandalised and burned. A bandh was announced in Leh, but the youth came in large numbers. This was youth's anger, a Gen-Z revolution,\" Wangchuk said as teargas shells were heard in the backdrop.Here are the top developmentsCentre accuses Wangchuk of inciting violenceCentre said that the mob violence in Ladakh was guided by activist Sonam Wangchuk.\"It is clear that mob violence in Ladakh was guided by activist Sonam Wangchuk through his provocative statements,\" the government said in a statement.'Vested interests'Ladakh lieutenant governor Kavinder Gupta alleged a conspiracy behind the statehood protest in Leh turning violent, claiming people were being incited by drawing parallels with the youth-led movements in Bangladesh and Nepal that toppled governments there.\"In a democratic system, protesting is a right. However, it must be done in a peaceful manner. For the past two days, attempts have been made to incite people, and the protest held here was compared to those held in Bangladesh and Nepal. This smells of a conspiracy behind the protest,\" Gupta told news agency ANI.4 dead,  30 injured At least four people died and 20 injured after the demonstrations turned deadly, officials said as the district administration imposed Section 163 of the BNS, banning gatherings of five or more, processions without approval, and statements that may disturb public peace.Also read: BJP accuses Congress of inciting mob, gets a reply from Sonam Wangchuk\"It has been brought to my notice that there is apprehension of disturbances to public peace and tranquillity, danger to human life and a possibility of law and order problem in the jurisdiction of District Leh. And whereas, I am satisfied that immediate prevention and remedial measures are necessary to maintain public order and tranquillity,\" Leh's district administration said.The DM also imposed a ban on processions, rally without prior written approval of the competent authority.BJP office set ablazeThis comes after agitators torched the BJP office in the city, pelted stones and clashed with police. Flames and dark smoke clouds could be seen from afar amid a complete shutdown in the Ladakh capital.Reinforcements were rushed to the scene and the situation was brought under control after several hours of intense clashes, officials monitoring the situation added.The protest call was given by the youth wing of the Leh Apex Body (LAB) to express solidarity with environmentalist Sonam Wangchuk, who was on a hunger strike for the past 14 days.Responding to the protest call, Leh town shut down and large crowds assembled at the NDS memorial ground and later took out a march through the streets of the town, chanting slogans in support of the Sixth Schedule and statehood, officials said.Why is Ladakh burning?Protest in the Union Territory is gathering pace demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh which was carved out from Jammu and Kashmir in 2019.Also read: Sonam Wangchuk calls off hunger strike, statehood stir ends after 15 daysThe Constitution's Sixth Schedule, meant for the tribal population of the four northeast states of Tripura, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Assam, makes special provisions in terms of governance, powers of president and the governor, type of local bodies, alternate judicial mechanisms and financial powers exercised through autonomous councils.The Ladakh Apex Body (LAB) youth wing called for the protest after two of the 15 people, who were on a 35-day hunger strike since September 10, were shifted to a hospital after their condition deteriorated on Tuesday evening.Meanwhile, a fresh round of talks is scheduled between the ministry of home affairs and Ladakh representatives, comprising members of the LAB and the Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), on October 6.Former MP and LAB chairperson Thupstan Chhewang, who had resigned from the body after the last round of talks on May 27, has returned to the helm and is likely to lead the joint delegation during the negotiations.",

You Can Also Check: Delhi AQI | Weather in Delhi | Gold Rate Today in Delhi | Silver Rate Today in DelhiNetflix and others have also been named in the case.In his plea, Wankhede sought relief in the form of a permanent and mandatory injunction, declaration and damages.\"This series disseminates a misleading and negative portrayal of anti-drug enforcement agencies, thereby eroding public confidence in law enforcement institutions,\" he said.He argued that the series was deliberately conceptualised and executed with the intent to malign Sameer Wankhede's reputation in a colourable and prejudicial manner, particularly while cases involving him and Aryan Khan are still before the Bombay high court and the NDPS Special Court in Mumbai.Also Read: Anupam Kher showers praise on Aryan Khans debut directorial 'Ba***ds of Bollywood'; hints at working in his next? The former NCB officer said the portrayal unfairly targets him at a time when the judicial scrutiny is ongoing. His suit also points to a sequence in the show where a character makes an obscene gesture after reciting Satyamev Jayate. Wankhede contends this is a grave and sensitive violation of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971, attracting penal consequences under law. He further claims the content contravenes provisions of the Information Technology Act and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) by seeking to outrage national sentiment through the use of obscene and offensive material. Wankhede has demanded damages of Rs 2 crore, which he has said should be donated to Tata Memorial Cancer Hospital for the treatment of cancer patients. The suit also seeks directions from the court to restrain streaming and distribution of the show, as well as a declaration of its defamatory nature. Wankhede has argued that, apart from harming his personal reputation, the content undermines faith in institutions responsible for enforcing drug laws. The Delhi high court is expected to hear the matter soon.According to Wankhede, the show misrepresents events linked to that investigation and portrays him in a negative light.'A bribery charge'In May 2023, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a case against former Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) officer Sameer Wankhede, accusing him of attempting to extort Rs 25 crore from Shah Rukh Khan. The case stems from a complaint by the NCB, which alleged that Wankhede and his associates sought the money in exchange for favourable treatment of Shah Rukh Khans son, Aryan Khan, during the 2021 cruise ship drugs investigation.The CBI has charged Wankhede under sections of the Indian Penal Code (Now BNS) relating to criminal conspiracy and extortion, as well as provisions of anti-corruption law. Wankhede has denied the allegations, calling them politically motivated. In his defence, he cited text messages exchanged with Shah Rukh Khan, claiming the respectful tone of the conversations disproves any suggestion of pressure or financial demands.",

Attorney Deepak Ahluwalia posted a video on Instagram detailing how things unfolded while the family was cooperating with the ICE and they were all ready to send Kaur back to Punjab as she had exhausted all her appeals to stay in the US.Also Read | 'Bring Grandma Home': Hundreds rally in California against Harjit Kaur's arrest; family demands her releaseBut the administration claimed that she was choosing to stay in the US, Ahluwalia said, adding that she was in connection with the ICE for 13 years for her travel documents which the ICE could not provide.The attorney said that neither he nor the family was notified when the administration transported Kaur from California detention center to the other part of the country in Georgia in handcuffs before being placed on a charter flight to India on September 19.Ahluwalia said they requested her release even on ankle monitor so that she could bid goodbye to her family and then travel to Punjab on a commercial flight. \"She was working lawfully in the country and paying taxes as she was waiting for her travel documents,\" Ahluwalia said.\"She was not given a bed for the last 48 hours of her life in the US. She asked for food to be taken for her medicine and she was given a tray of ice. It's not that she was not given any food at all. She was given a cheese sandwich. She asked for her dentures but she was told that it was her problem,\" Ahluwalia said. Kaur's detention triggered a major protest from the community and the Sikh Coalition described it as violation of basic standards. It is despicable that any human should be treated this way, and downright sickening that a 73-year-old woman was forced to endure it,\" the group said. ",

        "article_headline": "Ladakh protest: Home affairs ministry cancels FCRA certificate of Sonam Wangchuk's NGO",
        "article_body": "NEW DELHI: The ministry of home affairs cancelled the FCRA- Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act certificate of Sonam Wangchuk-led Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh after the Central Bureau of Investigation had initiated an inquiry.According to official findings, SECMOL received and deposited foreign contributions in contravention of Sections 8, 12, 17, 18 and 19 of the FCRA. The ministry alleged that in FY 2021-22, Sonam Wangchuk deposited Rs 3.35 lakh in SECMOLs FCRA account in violation of Section 17. While the association claimed the sum was the sale proceeds of an old bus purchased with FCRA funds and thus rightly deposited in the FCRA account, the government noted discrepancies between the transaction details in its returns and the actual bank credits, calling the explanation untenable. Authorities also flagged that in FY 2020-21, local contributions amounting to Rs 54,600 from three individuals were credited to the FCRA account instead of the local account, a violation admitted by the association as an inadvertent error.Also Read: CBI launches probe against Sonam Wangchuk for alleged FCRA violation; activist says guns blazing on us Further, SECMOL received Rs 4.93 lakh from Swedish organisation Framtidsjorden for youth-awareness programmes on migration, climate change and food security. While the NGO said the funds were used strictly for educational purposes, the ministry observed that part of the grant involved study on sovereignty of the country, which cannot be funded by foreign contributions under Section 12(4) of the Act.\"We received RS.4,93,205/- from framstidjorden for educational program for youths under the FE project for creating awareness among youth on issues such as migration, climate change, global warming, food security and Sovereignty and organic farming through different workshops and trainings. The funds were utilized stricty in line with the organization's objectives and for the specific purposes for which they were allocated. Hence, all these activities were educational and there was no violation,\" association replied. The ministry also pointed to a Rs 19,600 foreign donation returned to a donor during the Covid lockdown and a Rs 79,200 deduction from staff stipends that was recorded as food-fee receipts instead of disbursed salaries, which it said reflected poor accounting and possible violations of Sections 18 and 19.\"AND WHEREAS, in view of violations as enumerated above u/s 8(1)(a), 17,18,19 and conditions of registration under section 12(4)(f) (i) of the Act, the FCRA registration certificate of the association is liable to be cancelled in exercise of power u/s 14 of the Act,\" the statement read.Also Read: Himalaya Niti Abhiyan extends support to non-violent Ladakh movement\"NOW THEREFORE, considering the facts and position narrated in preceding paras, the Competent Authority, hereby, in exercise of the powers conferred under section 14(1) of the Act, cancels with immediate effect the FCRA Certificate of Registration No. 152710012R granted to the association \"Students Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh,\" the statement added.The CBI's investigation, based on a complaint from the Ministry of Home Affairs, began about 10 days ago when CBI officials visited the institution in Ladakh, PTI reported.Reacting to the MHA's statement, which had blamed him for provoking mob violence, Wangchuk stated that he is prepared to be arrested under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA). \"To say it was instigated by me, or sometimes by Congress, is to find a scapegoat, rather than addressing the core of the problem, and this will lead us nowhere. They may be clever in making somebody else a scapegoat, but they are not wise. At this time, we all need wisdom rather than 'cleverness' because youths are already frustrated,\" Wangchuk told PTI over the phone. The activist, who has been leading the peaceful agitation for statehood and constitutional safeguards for Ladakh, also raised concerns over his personal safety. \"I see they are building up a case to bring me under the Public Safety Act and throw me in jail for two years,\" he said, adding, \"I am ready for that, but Sonam Wangchuk in jail may cause them more problems than free Sonam Wangchuk.\"Over CBI probe on his institute for alleged FCRA violation, Activist Sonam Wangchuk told ANI, \"In the series of witch hunting, yesterday's events were the last and all blame was put on Sonam Wangchuk.\" \"A day later (after Leh protests), the Home Ministry of India issued a press release naming Sonam Wangchuk in it and blaming him... I had received a notice about a CBI inquiry stating that your organisation received foreign funding even when it did not have FCRA. We did not get FCRA because we don't want funds from abroad. United Nations team wanted to take our Passive Solar Heated Building to Afghanistan, and for this, they gave us a fee. We also got fees with tax from Switzerland and Italy organisations for supplying knowledge to them about our artificial glaciers...We are getting I-T summons. In the series of witch hunting, yesterday's events were the last and all blame was put on Sonam Wangchuk,\" he added. The investigation coincides with recent unrest in Ladakh, where the protest turned the violent protests that erupted in Ladakh on September 24 over demands for statehood and inclusion of the region under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. The protest took a violent turn with the BJP office and several vehicles set on fire and hundreds of people taking to the streets.The region experienced its worst violence since 1989 on Wednesday, with youth groups engaging in arson and vandalism at the BJP headquarters and Hill Council, including burning vehicles. Law enforcement had to use teargas to control the situation.",

Further, if their understanding is that Congress is going to grant them what they need, then good luck with that. For if it is one party that is responsible for their situation then it is the Congress.",

        "article_headline": "Wipro founder Azim Premji replies to Karnataka CM on Bengaluruâs traffic problem: âThere is no silver bullet to resolve it, so we suggest â¦â",
        "article_body": "Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has written to Wipro founder Azim Premji requesting the IT giant to allow limited vehicular movement through its campus to help ease Bengaluru's notorious traffic congestion on the Outer Ring Road. In a letter dated September 19, Siddaramaiah specifically targeted the severe traffic bottleneck at Iblur junction along the ORR corridor, writing: \"I wish to explore the possibility of allowing limited vehicular movement through the Wipro campus, subject to mutually agreed terms and necessary security considerations.\"Now, Wipro founder Azim Premji has responded to Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah letter. Permji has declined the request from the Karnataka government to part with a portion of the companys Bengaluru campus land to ease traffic congestion in the citys IT corridor. Premji said the decision was made in the best interests of the company and its employees, citing operational and security concerns.The Chief Minister cited preliminary assessments by traffic and urban mobility experts indicating that such a measure \"could reduce congestion on adjoining stretches of the ORR by nearly 30 per cent, particularly during peak office hours.\" A detailed traffic simulation study by Bengaluru Traffic Police has projected even more promising results, suggesting that opening the WiproEcoworld campus link road to the public could reduce travel time along the Sarjapur RoadOuter Ring Road corridor by nearly 38%.Responding to the letter Premji said that while he understood the traffic challenges of the city, but Wipro could not compromise on its campus integrity and longterm business needs.Read the full letter hereTo, Shri Siddaramaiah, Hon'ble Chief Minister of Karnataka, Vidhana Soudha, Bangalore - 560 001 Hon'ble Chief Minister,Sub: Re: Your Letter Regarding Traffic Congestion on Outer Ring Road (ORR) Thank you for your letter dated September 19, 2025 and your kind recognition of Wipro's contributions to Karnataka. We sincerely appreciate your leadership for initiatives concerning critical issue of traffic congestion in Bengaluru. As stated in your letter, urgent and effective measures are indeed required for the traffic situation, particularly along the Outer Ring Road, being an export oriented economic hub. The problem's complexity, stemming from multiple factors, suggests that there is unlikely to be a single point solution or a silver bullet to resolve it. To this end, we believe the most effective path forward is to commission a comprehensive, scientific study led by an entity with world-class expertise in urban transport management. Such an exercise would allow us to develop a holistic roadmap of effective solutions that are implementable in the short, medium, and long term. To demonstrate our commitment to being a part of the solution, Wipro will be pleased to engage in this process and underwrite a significant portion of the cost for this expert study. With respect to the specific suggestion of allowing public vehicular movement through our Sarjapur campus, we apprehend significant legal, governance, and statutory challenges since it is an exclusive private property owned by a listed company not intended for public thoroughfare. That apart it will also be appreciated that our Sarjapur campus is a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) providing services to global customers, our contractual conditions mandate stringent, non-negotiable access control norms for governance and compliance. Moreover, public vehicular movement through a private property would not be effective as a sustainable, long-term solution. Wipro nevertheless stands committed to partner with the Government of Karnataka to find a lasting solution for Bengaluru's mobility challenges. We believe a collaborative, data-driven approach will yield the most impactful results for our city.Our team, led by Reshmi Shankar (email: reshmi.shankar@wipro.com), would be happy to engage with your officials to discuss the way forward at your earliest convenience. Warm regards, Yours sincerely, AZIM PREMJI",

        "article_headline": "Trump to meet PM of Pakistan, a country he once called a terrorist safe haven",
        "article_body": "The TOI correspondent from Washington: US President Donald Trump is meeting Pakistans Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in the Oval Office on Thursday, advancing ties with a country he described in his first term as a terrorist safe-haven that has long conned America. The White House has listed Trumps meeting with Sharif for 4.30 pm EST (2 am IST) after bilateral meetings and lunch with Turkeys President Recep Tayyip Erdoan. The Pakistani prime minister buttonholed Trump on the sidelines of his meeting with eight Islamic-Arab countries in New York on Tuesday, and a 36-second video clip shared by Pakistans ministry of foreign affairs showed him emphatically making some point with his foreign minister Ishaq Dar by his side. Trumps meeting with Pakistans civilian leadership comes after two back-to-back visits to US by the countrys army chief and de facto military ruler Asim Munir, including a White House luncheon in which he proposed a Nobel Prize for the US president for ending the war Pakistan triggered with India with a terrorist attack in Pahalgam. The presidential lunch, unprecedented for a foreign military chief, signaled a remarkable US pivot that, according to several accounts, was facilitated by private American business interests in cryptocurrency tied to the Trump family. Pakistan has also pledged to throw open its purported mineral wealth to exploration by the US, which faces a shortage of critical rare earths on which China has a stranglehold. Earlier this month, the Missouri-based US Strategic Metals (USSM), specialising in the extraction, recycling, and mining of critical minerals such as cobalt, nickel, copper, and rare earth elements from lithium-ion batteries, inked a $500 million MoU with Pakistans National Logistics Corporation for recycling and mining these assets. In addition to the sweeteners, Pakistan also provides the gateway to the renewed US interest in Afghanistan, specifically retaking the Bagram Air Base outside Kabul, which President Trump has identified as vital to US national interests because of its proximity to Chinas nuclear assets. While there is little likelihood that Pakistan will ditch its higher than mountains, deeper than oceans, sweeter than honey friend and patron that has long patronised it, weaning Islamabad away from Beijing has long been a Washington objective that has taken on urgency with Chinas rise as the main US adversary. None of this was on the horizon during Trumps first term when he underscored Pakistans perfidy and its ties to terrorism. \"The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!\" he said in a January 1, 2018, post. On November 19 the same year, he said, \"We no longer pay Pakistan the $Billions because they would take our money and do nothing for us, Bin Laden being a prime example, Afghanistan being another. They were just one of many countries that take from the United States without giving anything in return. Thats ending!\" Indeed, Pakistan itself appears to have ended Trump's complaints by promising the US vast riches in crypto and mineral  along with endorsement for his Nobel Prize quest for ending its war with India, a claim that is now comedic gold dust for late-night talk show hosts. \"Trump says he ended seven wars in seven months. That's impressiveit's like if I said I lost seven pounds by eating seven Big Macs, joked CBS Stephen Colbert earlier this week. And from NBCs Seth Meyers: Trump ended seven wars, including India-Pakistansays who? India said, 'We handled it ourselves, thanks.' It's like Trump taking credit for ending my war on sleep by tweeting at 3 am.",
