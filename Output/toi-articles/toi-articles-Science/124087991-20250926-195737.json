        "articleBody": "NASA is preparing for a historic ten-day mission around the Moon, targeting a launch as early as February 2026. This will be the first crewed lunar flight in 50 years, marking a major milestone in humanityâs return to deep-space exploration and advancing plans for a long-term presence on the Moon. Originally planned for no later than April 2026, the mission has been moved forward, reflecting NASAâs confidence in its technology and commitment to maintaining leadership in space exploration. Four astronauts will travel beyond Earthâs orbit, testing the spacecraftâs systems, procedures, and safety measures. The mission will provide critical data and experience to support future lunar landings and ensure that upcoming missions can operate efficiently and safely.Artemis II mission 2026: Four astronauts to circle the Moon aboard NASAâs SLS and OrionThe Artemis II mission will carry four astronauts: Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch of NASA, and Jeremy Hansen of the Canadian Space Agency. All four will journey around the Moon without landing, becoming the first humans to travel beyond low Earth orbit since Apollo 17 in 1972.Lakiesha Hawkins, NASAâs acting deputy associate administrator, emphasised the historic significance: âWe together have a front-row seat to history. Safety is our top priority, but this mission is a major milestone in human space exploration.âAt the heart of the mission is NASAâs powerful Space Launch System (SLS), designed to propel the Orion spacecraft and its crew beyond Earth. Launch Director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson confirmed that the SLS rocket is nearly complete, with only final integration and ground testing of the Orion capsule remaining.Orion, which will serve as the astronautsâ home for the entire journey, will initially be boosted into Earth orbit by the SLS and two solid rocket boosters. These boosters will detach minutes after launch, having carried the heavy payload to orbit. Eight minutes after liftoff, the SLS core stage separates from Orion and the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS), allowing the spacecraftâs solar arrays to deploy and begin charging its batteries.Artemis II Moon mission: Orion prepares with orbit boost and safety checksFollowing launch, ICPS will perform an orbit-raising maneuver, and a comprehensive systems check will take place over the next 25 hours. If successful, Orion will separate from ICPS to conduct the Proximity Operations Demonstrationâa rehearsal of docking and maneuvering techniques essential for future lunar landings. Engineers and mission controllers will closely monitor spacecraft telemetry, communications, and life-support systems to ensure astronaut safety and mission success, while making real-time adjustments as needed.Twenty-three hours later, Orion will execute a Translunar Injection burn, propelling it on a four-day voyage that will carry astronauts more than 230,000 miles from Earth. During the journey, continuous systems monitoring will ensure all spacecraft functions perform optimally.Artemis II science and re-entry: Studying human health and returning safely from the MoonIn addition to testing spacecraft systems, Artemis II will provide unique scientific opportunities. NASA will study how extended space travel affects the human body by analyzing organoid tissue samples derived from the astronautsâ blood. Dr. Nicky Fox, NASAâs head of science, explained: âWe want to examine in detail the effects of microgravity and radiation on these samples. While we wonât dissect the astronauts, organoids allow us to understand physiological changes during spaceflight.âAfter slingshotting around the Moon, Orion will return to Earth over four days, guided by Earthâs gravity. Upon arrival, the service module, which houses the spacecraftâs primary propulsion, will separate from the crew module. The astronauts will then face the critical re-entry phase, descending through Earthâs atmosphere before parachuting safely into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California.Preparing for Artemis III: How Artemis II will help humans return to the MoonThe success of Artemis II is crucial for NASAâs next objective: Artemis III, which aims to land astronauts on the Moon. While NASA targets âno earlier than mid-2027â for this mission, experts like Dr. Simeon Barber of the Open University caution that this timeline is ambitious. Artemis III will depend on the readiness of SpaceXâs Starship to transport astronauts to and from the lunar surfaceâa system that still faces significant developmental challenges.Jeff Radigan, lead Artemis II flight director, highlighted the unprecedented distance the crew will travel: âTheyâre going at least 5,000 nautical miles past the Moon, farther than anyone has ever gone before. This mission will set the stage for humanityâs return to the lunar surface.âAlso read | NASA shares 8 jaw-dropping Milky Way images revealing the galaxyâs hidden wonders",
