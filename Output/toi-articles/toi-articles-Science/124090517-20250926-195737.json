It aims to provide young researchers with opportunities to pursue careers in universities, industry, national R&D laboratories, and academic institutions under the guidance of eminent scientists and professors across Science, Technology & Engineering, Medical, and Mathematical Sciences (STEMM), according to government release.The initiative expected to play a key role in advancing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for Indiaâs science and technology sector by increasing researchers per million population and expanding the pool of high-quality human resources.Indiaâs concerted R&D efforts over the past decade have strengthened its global position, improving its ranking to 39th in the 2024 Global Innovation Index (GII) by WIPO. According to NSF, USA data, India now ranks among the top three countries in scientific paper publications. The scheme has supported thousands of scholars and scientists whose outputs have contributed significantly to the countryâs scientific achievements.The Cabinet noted that the approval marks a milestone in CSIRâs 84-year history, consolidating the scheme into four sub-programmes: Doctoral and Postdoctoral Fellowships; Extramural Research Scheme, Emeritus Scientist Scheme, and Bhatnagar Fellowship; Promotion and Recognition of Excellence through awards; and knowledge sharing via Travel and Symposia Grants. The government said the initiative underscores its commitment to a robust, innovation-driven R&D ecosystem and preparing Indian science for global leadership in the 21st century.",
