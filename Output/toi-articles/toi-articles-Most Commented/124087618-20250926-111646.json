        "articleBody": "LEH: Protests rocked Leh region of Ladakh Union Territory on Wednesday as agitators torched the BJP office in the city, pelted stones and clashed with police.A police van was set ablaze during the chaos, marking a sharp escalation in the agitation that has been gaining momentum over the past weeks.The protest call was given by the youth wing of the Leh Apex Body (LAB) to express solidarity with environmentalist Sonam Wangchuk, who has been on a hunger strike for the past 14 days demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for the Union Territory.On September 20, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had announced the resumption of talks with Ladakhi leadership, with the next round scheduled for October 6.The home ministry had earlier set up a high-powered committee on January 2, 2023, after prolonged protests in Ladakh, with political forces under the LAB and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA) demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status.\"Whatever is happening in Leh is unfortunate. Ladakh, once peaceful, is now gripped by frustration & insecurity due to Govtâs failed UT experiment. The onus lies on the Govtâresume dialogue, act sensibly & fulfill Ladakhâs demand for Statehood & Sixth Schedule without delay. Also I appeal people to remain peaceful and steadfast,\" Sajad Kargili, leader of Kargil Democratic Front wrote on XThe last round of talks between the committee and the joint leadership of LAB and KDA, both formed after the abrogation of Article 370, was held on May 27, leading to the introduction of a domicile policy in Ladakh. Since then, no talks have been held.",

        "Sonam wangchuk is making a huge mistake. Remember being a UT is better then a district of J&amp;amp;K. Sixth schedule like NE states is not possible in Ladakh given its location next to J&amp;amp;K. Because then J&amp;amp;K might ask for the same. I bet its being flamed by Scamgress. Very bad that Sonam wangchuk cannot see the longterm implication, this agitation will be taken over by the Kargil Muslims and eventually the Buddhists will be disenfranchised by the them in cahoots with the valley pop...",
