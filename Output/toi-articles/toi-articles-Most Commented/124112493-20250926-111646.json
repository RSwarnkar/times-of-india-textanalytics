        "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: Former Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) Mumbai zonal director and Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer Sameer Wankhede has filed a defamation suit in the Delhi high court against Red Chillies Entertainment Pvt Ltd, the production company owned by Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan and his wife, Gauri Khan.Also Read: 'The Ba***ds of Bollywood' cast fees revealedThe suit concerns Aryan Khanâs directorial debut series, The Ba***ds of Bollywood, which Wankhede claims has damaged his reputation.

The former NCB officer said the portrayal unfairly targets him âat a time when the judicial scrutiny is ongoingâ. His suit also points to a sequence in the show where a character makes an obscene gesture after reciting Satyamev Jayate. Wankhede contends this is a âgrave and sensitive violationâ of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971, attracting penal consequences under law. He further claims the content contravenes provisions of the Information Technology Act and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) by seeking to âoutrage national sentiment through the use of obscene and offensive material.â Wankhede has demanded damages of Rs 2 crore, which he has said should be donated to Tata Memorial Cancer Hospital for the treatment of cancer patients. The suit also seeks directions from the court to restrain streaming and distribution of the show, as well as a declaration of its defamatory nature. Wankhede has argued that, apart from harming his personal reputation, the content âundermines faith in institutions responsible for enforcing drug laws.â The Delhi high court is expected to hear the matter soon.According to Wankhede, the show misrepresents events linked to that investigation and portrays him in a negative light.'A bribery charge'In May 2023, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a case against former Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) officer Sameer Wankhede, accusing him of attempting to extort Rs 25 crore from Shah Rukh Khan. The case stems from a complaint by the NCB, which alleged that Wankhede and his associates sought the money in exchange for favourable treatment of Shah Rukh Khanâs son, Aryan Khan, during the 2021 cruise ship drugs investigation.The CBI has charged Wankhede under sections of the Indian Penal Code (Now BNS) relating to criminal conspiracy and extortion, as well as provisions of anti-corruption law. Wankhede has denied the allegations, calling them politically motivated. In his defence, he cited text messages exchanged with Shah Rukh Khan, claiming the respectful tone of the conversations disproves any suggestion of pressure or financial demands.",

        "Fully agree with mr Whankhade , it was deliberately portrayed in the serial to defame the NCB that too in a very very demeaning way. Action must be taken against the serial Owners",
        "If there was smoke there was fire, I find it hard to believe SRK's son was present for no reason when drugs were going around on that particular boat and that particular day when some of his friends were caught with drugs. Most of the Bollywood nepo brats seem to be spoiled trying to mimic Western celebrity lifestyle leaving them na ghar ka, na ghaat ka.",
        "Dont know who is real victim here. Imagine being a victim and your name is maligned for doing your job as law enforcement officer or  being a son of Popular actor you are targettes to extort money and put in jail. Hope to know the truth soon and real culprit is punished",

        "Sameer Wankhede should have arrested drug mafia of Mumbai, the boy with litte drug that also not sure kept in Jail for 11 days, not big fan of Bollywood, but it seems Sameer wanted fame or money or both, he is not innocent for sure",
        "Extortionist putting a defamation case on his victim. If the victim was not Sharukh Khan's son, the extortionist would have got away with it.",
