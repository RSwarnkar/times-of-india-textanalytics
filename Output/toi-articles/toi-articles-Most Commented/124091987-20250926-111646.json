        "Statehood for the region is risky given the shaky situation with the border. The agitation by Dr Sonam is simply driven by anti national elements. He needs to stop this.",
        "Indira,Rahul’s grandma, declared emergency clearly for personal power gain, not for the country’s benefit. But when the Indian nation is facing multiple serious challenges from anti-nationalists, it’s high time for Modi Shah to be strong like Trump, MBS, Xi Jinping, Putin and declare emergency to control law and order nationwide. People want to live in peace. Expel criminal illegals like Pak did with Afghans. Replace corrupt judges. Reverse discriminatory anti-Hindu laws HRCE, POW. Establish Sanatan Board. Send fake Gandhi family, Mamata, Arvind, Lalu, Mamta, etc to the their  beloved ultra secular Pakistan or Afghanistan in exchange of with the persecuted minorities there.",
        "Deal with High handedness no mercy should be shown to the destructers of countries assets whoever it may be",
        "It is high time that central government takes strictest possible action against such activists and more importantly people behind it . No mercy at all",
        "The recent violence in Ladakh is deeply concerning. The demand for statehood by the people of Ladakh reflects their desire for greater autonomy and control over their region. While protests can be an effective way to express grievances, violence only leads to harm and instability. The government's decision to ban protests for now is likely aimed at restoring peace, but it's also crucial for the authorities to engage in dialogue with the people of Ladakh to understand their concerns and work towards a solution that meets their needs. Peaceful resolution and mutual understanding are key to addressing this complex issue"
