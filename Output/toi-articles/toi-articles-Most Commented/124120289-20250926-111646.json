        "articleBody": "Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has written to Wipro founder Azim Premji requesting the IT giant to allow limited vehicular movement through its campus to help ease Bengaluru's notorious traffic congestion on the Outer Ring Road. In a letter dated September 19, Siddaramaiah specifically targeted the severe traffic bottleneck at Iblur junction along the ORR corridor, writing: \"I wish to explore the possibility of allowing limited vehicular movement through the Wipro campus, subject to mutually agreed terms and necessary security considerations.\"Now, Wipro founder Azim Premji has responded to Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah letter. Permji has declined the request from the Karnataka government to part with a portion of the companyÃ¢Â€Â™s Bengaluru campus land to ease traffic congestion in the cityÃ¢Â€Â™s IT corridor. Premji said the decision was made in the best interests of the company and its employees, citing operational and security concerns.The Chief Minister cited preliminary assessments by traffic and urban mobility experts indicating that such a measure \"could reduce congestion on adjoining stretches of the ORR by nearly 30 per cent, particularly during peak office hours.\" A detailed traffic simulation study by Bengaluru Traffic Police has projected even more promising results, suggesting that opening the WiproÃ¢Â€Â“Ecoworld campus link road to the public could reduce travel time along the Sarjapur RoadÃ¢Â€Â“Outer Ring Road corridor by nearly 38%.Responding to the letter Premji said that while he understood the traffic challenges of the city, but Wipro could not compromise on its campus integrity and longÃ¢Â€Â‘term business needs.Read the full letter hereTo, Shri Siddaramaiah, Hon'ble Chief Minister of Karnataka, Vidhana Soudha, Bangalore - 560 001 Hon'ble Chief Minister,Sub: Re: Your Letter Regarding Traffic Congestion on Outer Ring Road (ORR) Thank you for your letter dated September 19, 2025 and your kind recognition of Wipro's contributions to Karnataka. We sincerely appreciate your leadership for initiatives concerning critical issue of traffic congestion in Bengaluru. As stated in your letter, urgent and effective measures are indeed required for the traffic situation, particularly along the Outer Ring Road, being an export oriented economic hub. The problem's complexity, stemming from multiple factors, suggests that there is unlikely to be a single point solution or a silver bullet to resolve it. To this end, we believe the most effective path forward is to commission a comprehensive, scientific study led by an entity with world-class expertise in urban transport management. Such an exercise would allow us to develop a holistic roadmap of effective solutions that are implementable in the short, medium, and long term. To demonstrate our commitment to being a part of the solution, Wipro will be pleased to engage in this process and underwrite a significant portion of the cost for this expert study. With respect to the specific suggestion of allowing public vehicular movement through our Sarjapur campus, we apprehend significant legal, governance, and statutory challenges since it is an exclusive private property owned by a listed company not intended for public thoroughfare. That apart it will also be appreciated that our Sarjapur campus is a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) providing services to global customers, our contractual conditions mandate stringent, non-negotiable access control norms for governance and compliance. Moreover, public vehicular movement through a private property would not be effective as a sustainable, long-term solution. Wipro nevertheless stands committed to partner with the Government of Karnataka to find a lasting solution for Bengaluru's mobility challenges. We believe a collaborative, data-driven approach will yield the most impactful results for our city.Our team, led by Reshmi Shankar (email: reshmi.shankar@wipro.com), would be happy to engage with your officials to discuss the way forward at your earliest convenience. Warm regards, Yours sincerely, AZIM PREMJI",

Also they exploit non kannadigas, everywhere... Right from buses, autos to land registration.. shamelessly asking for money..",
        "Well, the CM should have written the letter in Kannada. Speaking and writing in Kannada will solve the traffic issue....Ã°   Ã°   ",
        "If this is the solution that the Karnataka Government came up with for the vehicular congestion, then all you can do is pity the state of affairs!!",
        "And comgress wants to lead centre ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ they should start with managing gram panchayat first ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚",
        "Govt should stop finding short cuts. Why the individuals and private companies be victim of govt mismanagement andnpoor urban town planning? In my city, we have to go around 10 -20 kms just to bypass the airport and long runway. Can we make a road passing theough the airport to ease the traffic? If govt is really worried about traffic then they should spend money to make tunnels or flyovers but then they have to stop corruption.",
        "Mr Azim Premji knows how these vultures may try to capture his land in later point of time. These Congress is good to look others land, money and property to grab by all means.",
        "Wipro camp is it's personal property.",
        "Happy with Mr.Premji's decision. These incompetent politicians do not deserve such gestures. It is their complete mismanagement of the city which has created the message. Let them stop freebies and use the money for infrastructure development.",
        "This is a way of congress to take from people who has earned by hard work and give to others who are not ready to work hard.",
        "Freebies and cut to italian owners. How will karnataka manage. Their small time leaders get caught with hundreds of crores even today."
