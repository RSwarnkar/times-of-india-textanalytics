        "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: The ministry of home affairs cancelled the FCRA- Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act certificate of Sonam Wangchuk-led Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh after the Central Bureau of Investigation had initiated an inquiry.According to official findings, SECMOL received and deposited foreign contributions in contravention of Sections 8, 12, 17, 18 and 19 of the FCRA. The ministry alleged that in FY 2021-22, Sonam Wangchuk deposited Rs 3.35 lakh in SECMOLâs FCRA account in violation of Section 17. While the association claimed the sum was the sale proceeds of an old bus purchased with FCRA funds and thus rightly deposited in the FCRA account, the government noted discrepancies between the transaction details in its returns and the actual bank credits, calling the explanation âuntenable.â Authorities also flagged that in FY 2020-21, local contributions amounting to Rs 54,600 from three individuals were credited to the FCRA account instead of the local account, a violation admitted by the association as an âinadvertentâ error.Also Read: CBI launches probe against Sonam Wangchuk for alleged FCRA violation; activist says âguns blazing on usâ Further, SECMOL received Rs 4.93 lakh from Swedish organisation Framtidsjorden for youth-awareness programmes on migration, climate change and food security. While the NGO said the funds were used strictly for educational purposes, the ministry observed that part of the grant involved âstudy on sovereignty of the country,â which cannot be funded by foreign contributions under Section 12(4) of the Act.\"We received RS.4,93,205/- from framstidjorden for educational program for youths under the FE project for creating awareness among youth on issues such as migration, climate change, global warming, food security and Sovereignty and organic farming through different workshops and trainings. The funds were utilized stricty in line with the organization's objectives and for the specific purposes for which they were allocated. Hence, all these activities were educational and there was no violation,\" association replied. The ministry also pointed to a Rs 19,600 foreign donation returned to a donor during the Covid lockdown and a Rs 79,200 deduction from staff stipends that was recorded as food-fee receipts instead of disbursed salaries, which it said reflected poor accounting and possible violations of Sections 18 and 19.\"AND WHEREAS, in view of violations as enumerated above u/s 8(1)(a), 17,18,19 and conditions of registration under section 12(4)(f) (i) of the Act, the FCRA registration certificate of the association is liable to be cancelled in exercise of power u/s 14 of the Act,\" the statement read.Also Read: Himalaya Niti Abhiyan extends support to non-violent Ladakh movement\"NOW THEREFORE, considering the facts and position narrated in preceding paras, the Competent Authority, hereby, in exercise of the powers conferred under section 14(1) of the Act, cancels with immediate effect the FCRA Certificate of Registration No. 152710012R granted to the association \"Students Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh,\" the statement added.The CBI's investigation, based on a complaint from the Ministry of Home Affairs, began about 10 days ago when CBI officials visited the institution in Ladakh, PTI reported.Reacting to the MHA's statement, which had blamed him for provoking mob violence, Wangchuk stated that he is prepared to be arrested under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA). \"To say it was instigated by me, or sometimes by Congress, is to find a scapegoat, rather than addressing the core of the problem, and this will lead us nowhere. They may be clever in making somebody else a scapegoat, but they are not wise. At this time, we all need wisdom rather than 'cleverness' because youths are already frustrated,\" Wangchuk told PTI over the phone. The activist, who has been leading the peaceful agitation for statehood and constitutional safeguards for Ladakh, also raised concerns over his personal safety. \"I see they are building up a case to bring me under the Public Safety Act and throw me in jail for two years,\" he said, adding, \"I am ready for that, but Sonam Wangchuk in jail may cause them more problems than free Sonam Wangchuk.\"Over CBI probe on his institute for alleged FCRA violation, Activist Sonam Wangchuk told ANI, \"In the series of witch hunting, yesterday's events were the last and all blame was put on Sonam Wangchuk.\" \"A day later (after Leh protests), the Home Ministry of India issued a press release naming Sonam Wangchuk in it and blaming him... I had received a notice about a CBI inquiry stating that your organisation received foreign funding even when it did not have FCRA. We did not get FCRA because we don't want funds from abroad. United Nations team wanted to take our Passive Solar Heated Building to Afghanistan, and for this, they gave us a fee. We also got fees with tax from Switzerland and Italy organisations for supplying knowledge to them about our artificial glaciers...We are getting I-T summons. In the series of witch hunting, yesterday's events were the last and all blame was put on Sonam Wangchuk,\" he added. The investigation coincides with recent unrest in Ladakh, where the protest turned the violent protests that erupted in Ladakh on September 24 over demands for statehood and inclusion of the region under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. The protest took a violent turn with the BJP office and several vehicles set on fire and hundreds of people taking to the streets.The region experienced its worst violence since 1989 on Wednesday, with youth groups engaging in arson and vandalism at the BJP headquarters and Hill Council, including burning vehicles. Law enforcement had to use teargas to control the situation.",

        "Now, there will be reports about alleged harrassment against so called environment activist Wangchuk in western media. Fake himan rights activists, some of them Indian origin will create a hue and cry from their foreign safe havens. Countries like Sweden, Norway and others often act as surrogates for the  US and UK to funnel money and support for regime change agenda. These countries are not military powers and don’t indulge in traditional arm twisting tactics of the west and hence pass under the Radar as being peace loving and non interfering. But they have a quiet role to play in extending Western hagemony.",
        "To me the NGO angle is not a very solid one. Mainly because, the amounts are very small (what are few lacs for an NGO in in today's world?). However, Mr. Wangchuk needs to be held accountable for his culpability. You cannot  stand with an issue but it turns violent just move away. In addition, his tone doesn't sound conciliatory at all, which increases suspicion that he wanted something like this to happen. On a separate note, I am not sure what the problem with Ladakhis is? Till few years ago they were part of J&amp;amp;K and completely ignored. It is the BJP that separated them from J&amp;amp;K, which is the first step towards making the region self governing. It is the BJP that has given teeth to the Ladakh Development Council. Yet somehow they are holding BJP responsible. Further, if their understanding is that Congress is going to grant them what they need, then good luck with that. For if it is one party that is responsible for their situation then it is the Congress.",
        "Good move.  All such NGOs should be banned and certificates cancelled; they are used by foreign hand to create unrest in India",
        "Why is it so hard for Govt. to find who is funding this? Get to the bottom of it like Israel does and share the proof widely. The foreign funding along with opposition will lose credibility once and for all. They missed the opportunity during the farmers protest as well where there were a bunch of non-farmers pretended to be farmers and protested. They just had to interview one and let him confess on video.",
