NEW DELHI: The Karnataka high court on Thursday declined to stay the socio-educational survey, popularly known as a caste survey, in the state. The court, however, asked the authorities to issue a notification that participation is voluntary and not to disclose any data obtained from participants.The survey - which will record the social, economic, educational, and political representation of every caste and community in Karnataka - is the second such in 10 years. This time, the state is relying heavily on technology to help them complete the enumeration process in 15 days.The survey got off to a sluggish start on Monday, with 1.7 lakh enumerators covering barely 400 houses and 1,100 people in Karnataka by noon. Officials said the pace was expected to pick up in the coming days, with field timings fixed between 9am and 5pm.KA Dayanand, member-secretary of Karnataka State Commission for Backward Classes (KSCBC), attributed the slow beginning to teething troubles. "Today being Day 1, we expected a slow start, as enumerators had to download these applications and start using them. We will see more traction in the next couple of days," he told TOI.Complaints poured in from across the state about delays and glitches in the mobile application used for the exercise. Delays in receiving OTPs for Aadhaar authentication left many respondents impatient."With enumerators having a larger area to cover, 150 houses per block and asking responses for 60 questions per household, a delay of 2-5 minutes in verifying credentials of respondents has become time-consuming," one enumerator said.In several cases, final submissions were not accepted by the software, while poor network connectivity in rural areas compounded the problem.In Bengaluru Urban and Dakshina Kannada districts, fieldwork did not start even by Monday. While officials cited incomplete training as a reason for delays in Bengaluru, confusion reigned in Dakshina Kannada, where enumerators doubling as booth-level officers were also burdened with Election Commission's forthcoming special intensive revision of voter lists.Teachers pressed into the survey raised concerns about downloading the app and securing an uninterrupted mobile network. Chandrashekar Nugli, president of Primary School Teachers' Association, said, "We expect these things to stabilise, with our teachers picking up pace from tomorrow."Enumerators spoke of the hurdles they faced on Day 1. "We collected the kit at Ron tahsildar's office. We could only download the app - KSBC Social and Educational Survey - by noon. We were told to do a census of 4-5 houses, but could not do it due to technical difficulties. Some of our colleagues, though, started it, but many of us couldn't," Vijayalaxmi, a teacher in Gadag district, said.Kamala, a teacher in Haveri district, said: "...I started the survey, but the first family failed to provide adequate information, so I couldn't upload the details. I successfully uploaded details from the second house after 3 hours."

NEW DELHI: Wayanad District Congress Committee (DCC) president N D Appachan on Thursday resigned from his position amidst reported internal group conflicts in the party's local leadership here, party sources told PTI. When the media asked about his resignation, Appachan said that he communicated his decision to the party, and it was for the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) to decide whether to accept it. "If they accept it, I will go. If they want me to continue, let them say so," he said. He also said he was "not very keen" on continuing as the DCC president. On being asked the reason behind his resignation, he said he would not disclose that. The move comes two days after the party's Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi concluded her over-a-week-long constituency visit.The Wayanad Congress has been facing factionalism and controversy, particularly in connection with the deaths by suicide of former DCC treasurer N M Vijayan and his son in Dec 2024, followed by the suicide of Jose Nelledam, a grama panchayat member in Mullankolly on Sept 12 this year, and the suicide attempt by Vijayan's daughter-in-law Padmaja Vijesh last week.Earlier, TOI reported that a change in the party's district leadership would likely see N D Appachan replaced as DCC president.

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray on Thursday hinted at a major expose regarding alleged irregularities in the 2024 Maharashtra assembly election electoral rolls. Thackeray likened the upcoming revelations to the Indian Armys 2016 surgical strikes in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, suggesting the expose would be equally explosive. However, he refused to reveal the timing of the disclosure. Let me not leak it. We cannot let out the timings of the surgical strike. Our party has found many chinks in the armour and it will bring them out very soon, he said at the India Today Conclave in Mumbai, news agency PTI reported.Just before the assembly polls, the party had written to the Election Commission of India (ECI) about the sudden spike in the number of voters, missing names of voters, and mismanagement at the booth. We will have a press conference with the data we are working on right now. We are putting it together, he added.When asked if he would hold press conferences similar to those conducted by Congress MP and Shiv Sena (UBT) ally Rahul Gandhi, the Worli MLA replied in the affirmative. Gandhi has addressed two press conferenceson August 7 and September 18labelling the first one an atom bomb and teasing a future hydrogen bomb, alleging vote chori (vote theft) by the ECI to benefit the ruling BJP. Both focused on assembly seats in Congress-ruled Karnataka.The ECI dismissed Gandhis allegations as incorrect and baseless, asking him to sign a sworn affidavit. He has refused, stating he has already taken an oath on the Constitution of India. The Maharashtra assembly polls, held in November 2024, saw the BJP-led Mahayuti sweep the state to retain power, while the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprising the Congress, Shiv Sena, and NCP (SP), was routed. The result was the opposite of the Lok Sabha elections held just months earlier, fuelling opposition suspicions.

Expressing serious concerns over the situation in Ladakh, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday questioned if the country gained freedom from the British only to become slaves to the Bharatiya Janata Party instead of the invaders.In a post on social media X, Kejriwal, in a strongly worded post, alleged that the BJP was 'intoxicated' by the addiction of power and was turning one state after another into a Union Territory, and was snatching away the rights granted by the Constitution."What is happening in Ladakh today is extremely alarming. Every true patriot should stand with the people of Ladakh. Did we take freedom from the British just so that the public would become slaves to the BJP instead of the British? Revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad sacrificed their lives for democracy so that every Indian would have the right to choose their own government. But today, the BJP, intoxicated by the addiction of power, is turning one state after another into a Union Territory, snatching away the rights granted by the Constitution," the post read.Kejriwal further alleged in his post that the BJP was 'suppressing' the voice of the people of Ladakh and, despite repeated promises, had denied the right to vote to the people.Highlighting the presence of a dictatorship in the country, Kejriwal, through his post, urged the people to speak against the government in the fight for democracy."What are the people of Ladakh demanding? They are simply asking for their right to vote, the right to choose their government. But the BJP is suppressing their voice. Despite repeatedly promising, it is not giving them the right to vote. Democracy is the voice of the people... and when the government starts suppressing that very voice, it becomes the duty of the people to speak even louder. If we want to save the democracy of the country, we cannot remain silent against this dictatorship anymore. Today's fight in Ladakh could become the fight of the entire country tomorrow," the post further read.Meanwhile, Lieutenant Governor of Ladakh, Kavinder Gupta, chaired a high-level security review meeting on Thursday to assess the situation following protests demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status that turned violent, resulting in clashes with the police.He stressed the need for heightened vigilance, stronger inter-agency coordination, and proactive steps to ensure peace, security, and public order across the Union Territory.

NEW DELHI: National Conference president Farooq Abdullah on Thursday said the Centre should hold talks with the people of Ladakh to address their aspirations, and expressed concerns over the future of children. While talking with reporters, Abdullah warned that if a void is left in the border state, someone else (China) will try to fill it, PTI reported."I want to tell the government that it (Ladakh) is a border state. China is lurking, they have occupied land. It is time to resolve it quickly. The government should hold talks and resolve it," Abdullah told reporters here.Four people were killed and at least 80 injured during day-long clashes on Wednesday in Ladakh, triggered by a shutdown organised by the Leh Apex Body (LAB), which supports an agitation for statehood. Former chief minister Abdullah addressed reporters in the region, asserting that Ladakh is a border state threatened by Chinas presence. When questioned about the govt's allegation that climate activist Sonam Wangchuk was responsible for the violence, Abdullah stated that Wangchuk was not involved. "He (Wangchuk) has never left the Gandhian way. The youth have sidelined him today. He is not responsible for it. When they (BJP) lost elections, they imposed safety law and put people in jails. Now they are using CBI. More they use force to suppress, the bigger the danger. I want to tell the govt of India not to use force and instead hold dialogue," he added. Abdullah dismissed claims of external forces inciting trouble in Ladakh. "There is no external hand. It is the voice of the people," he said. He noted that for the past five years, Ladakhis have been quietly protesting for sixth schedule and statehood. "Their leader walked from Leh to Delhi to press for the demands. He adopted Gandhian way, not agitation. But the youth felt that the promises were hollow. The result was that they could not bear it any more," he stated. The former CM called on the Centre to learn from the Ladakh situation and honour its promises regarding Jammu and Kashmir. "Statehood was promised to Jammu and Kashmir but where is it? They should learn a lesson. Where are the promises you made with us? Where are the jobs? People from outside are being imposed," he said. When asked if his party supported the violent agitation in Ladakh, Abdullah affirmed that the National Conference adheres to the Gandhian way. "We gave sacrifices but never took to violence. However, what the youth do in future, I cannot say that for sure," he said. In response to BJP blaming Congress for the Ladakh violence, Abdullah described it as an attempt to deflect responsibility. "BJP has been ruling since 2019. Where did the Congress come from? They (BJP) always try to deflect. Congress cannot gather 10 persons," he said. Abdullah held Central govt leaders accountable for the situation in Ladakh. "Hold talks, don't talk about holding talks ...The leaders in Delhi are responsible for what is happening. They kept them busy with talks without anything substantial. They (youth) are feeling let down. The govt should move now faster and resolve the issue," he added. He warned that leaving a void in the Ladakh region could allow others to fill it. "Somebody will fill the gap. It is a very sensitive area. They (China) are craving for Ladakh. The Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) had gone to China. Why did he go there? To improve relations," Abdullah said. Commenting on international relations, Abdullah stated that the United States was blaming India for Russias war on Ukraine. "America is coming after us for buying Russian oil. President Trump accused us of supporting war on Ukraine but the truth is we have not supported it," he said. Reacting to the govts assertion that no land has been occupied by China in Ladakh, Abdullah asserted that the world is aware of China's land acquisitions. "We cannot even patrol our land. How long we will live in a world of lies?" he charged.

NEW DELHI: Central Bureau of Investigation has launched an inquiry into alleged violations of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) involving institutions founded by Ladakh-based educationist and activist Sonam Wangchuk, officials told news agency PTI.Also Read | Violence, arson, anger: What sparked deadly protests in Ladakh? What are people demanding?According to CBI sources cited by ANI, the investigation pertains to alleged violations of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA). In August, the Ladakh administration revoked the land allotment previously granted to the Himalayan Institute of Alternative Learning (HIAL).Wangchuk told PTI that a CBI team arrived around ten days ago with "an order" stating that they were acting on a complaint from the Ministry of Home Affairs concerning possible FCRA violations at the Himalayan Institute of Alternatives Ladakh (HIAL). "The order said we have not taken clearance under FCRA to receive foreign funds. We don't want to be dependent on foreign funds, but we export our knowledge and raise revenue. In three such instances, they thought it was foreign contribution," he said.Also Read | Ladakh protest: Farooq Abdullah urges Centre to initiate talks; warns of China threatMeanwhile, tensions in the region have escalated, with Leh witnessing its worst violence since 1989 on Wednesday. Youths set fire to vehicles, vandalised property, and attacked the BJP headquarters and the Hill Council building, prompting police and paramilitary forces to fire teargas shells to restore order.Leh's main market remained deserted on Thursday with shops shut a day after violence in the city. Section 163 of the BNSS has been imposed, banning gatherings of five or more people. Lieutenant Governor Kavinder Gupta also chaired a high-level security review meeting, stressing the need for increased vigilance, strong inter-agency coordination, and proactive steps to maintain peace, security, and public order throughout the Union Territory.'Guns blazing from all sides on us'Wangchuk explained that the CBI team visited both HIAL and the Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL), seeking details of funds received between 2022 and 2024. Wangchuk maintained that the transactions in question were legitimate service agreements with taxes duly paid, involving work for the United Nations, a Swiss university and an Italian organisation. "It was a very dignified assignment. They saw it and they were convinced. They understood it is not helping them, so they began asking for accounts outside that period," he alleged.Also Read: Ladakh violence: 'Gen Z revolution' or 'conspiracy motivated by politics'? What we knowAccording to him, investigators extended their scrutiny beyond the mandated timeframe, even approaching schools not mentioned in the complaint. He said these schools provide free education to needy students, with stipends for project work at HIAL. "The CBI officers are still camping in Ladakh and rigorously going through records," he added, while noting that he has not personally been questioned.Wangchuk also claimed that this investigation followed a series of actions against him, including a sedition case filed by local police and an order revoking land allotted for HIAL on grounds of unpaid lease fees. "Everyone knows, we have documents to show. The government had almost been apologetic in saying that their lease policy is not formed and hence it cannot take fee. It said 'please bear with us and continue constructions'," he said.He further alleged that this was followed by income tax summons and the revival of an old complaint about unpaid labourers. "The funny part is, Ladakh is one place where there is no tax. Yet I voluntarily pay taxes, and I get summons. Then they resurrected a four-year-old complaint that labourers were not paid properly. It is guns blazing from all sides on us," he remarked.

India is moving forward to achieve its goal of 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047."He expressed happiness after more than 2250 exhibitors displayed their products and services.

NEW DELHI: Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan said that the use of Air Force during the 1962 Sino-Indian war "would have slowed Chinese offensive considerably." However, he added that it would have been considered "escalatory" in nature at that time, which wasn't the case during Operation Sindoor. "They would have had a significant advantage during the 1962 conflict. Shorter turnaround times, a favourable geography and the ability to bring maximum payloads to bear with maximum weight on the enemy. Use of air power would have slowed the Chinese offensive considerably, if not stymied it completely," he said."This would have given the Army much more time to prepare. In those days, I think, the use of the Air Force was considered escalatory. This, I think, is no longer true, and Operation Sindoor is an apt example of this," he added. His remarks came in a recorded video message on Wednesday at the release of revised autobiography of late Lieutenant General SPP Thorat, titled 'Reveille to Retreat.'CDS's reasoning for 'flawed' policyHe termed the use of uniform policy in Ladakh and NEFA (North-East Frontier Agency), present-day Arunachal Pradesh, "flawed."Explaining his viewpoint, he said that Ladakh and NEFA had very different contexts -- former had significant Chinese occupation, while India's claim in the latter was stronger. "All I can say is that the forward policy should not have been applied uniformly to Ladakh and NEFA. The two regions had very different histories of the dispute, a different security context and entirely different terrain," he said."In Ladakh, China had already occupied much of Indian territory, whereas in NEFA, the legitimacy of India's claim was stronger. To equate the two and pursue identical policies was, in my view, a bit flawed," he added.However, he did note that views on forward policy would be coloured due to changed "To comment on the adequacy or inadequacy of the forward policy at this time is slightly difficult. Our views will be coloured due to many reasons, like geography has changed entirely and so has geopolitics," he said.

NEW DELHI: Asserting that India needs to demonstrate leadership on the issue of Palestine, Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi on Thursday slammed the Modi government's stance, saying its response has been characterised by a "profound silence" and an abdication of both humanity and morality.She said the government's actions appear to be driven primarily by the personal friendship between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu and rather than India's constitutional values or its strategic interests."This style of personalised diplomacy is never tenable and cannot be the guiding compass of India's foreign policy. Attempts to do the same in other parts of the world, most notably in the United States , have come undone in the most painful and humiliating ways in recent months," Gandhi said in her article published in The Hindu.This is the third article by Gandhi on the Israel-Palestine conflict, published in a national daily in the recent past, in which she has vehemently criticised the Modi government's stance on the issue.India's standing on the world stage cannot be wrapped up into the personal glory-seeking ways of one individual, nor can it rest on its historical laurels. It demands persistent courage and a sense of historical continuity, she said in her article titled 'India's muted voice, its detachment with Palestine'.Gandhi pointed out that France has joined the United Kingdom, Canada, Portugal and Australia in recognising Palestinian statehood -- "the first step in the fulfilment of the legitimate aspirations of the long-suffering Palestinian people".More than 150 of the 193 countries that are members of the United Nations have now done so, she said.Gandhi underlined that India had been a leader in this regard having formally recognised Palestinian statehood way back on November 18, 1988, after years of support to the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).She cited the examples of how India raised the issue of Apartheid South Africa even before Independence and during the Algerian struggle for independence (1954-62), India was one of the strongest voices for an independent Algeria.In 1971, India intervened firmly to prevent genocide in what was then East Pakistan, midwifing the birth of modern-day Bangladesh, she pointed out.On the critical and sensitive issue of Israel-Palestine as well, India has long maintained a delicate but principled position, emphasising its commitment to peace and the protection of human rights, the former Congress chief said.India needs to demonstrate leadership on the issue of Palestine, which is now a battle for justice, identity, dignity and human rights, Gandhi asserted.In the last two years, since the outbreak of hostilities between Israel and Palestine in October 2023, India has all but relinquished its role, she opined."The brutal and inhumane Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians on October 7, 2023, were followed by an Israeli response that has been nothing less than genocidal. As I have previously raised, more than 55,000 Palestinian civilians have been killed, including 17,000 children," she said.The residential, schooling and health infrastructure of the Gaza Strip has been obliterated, as have agriculture and industry, Gandhi said."Gazans have been forced into a famine-like situation, with the Israeli military cruelly obstructing the delivery of much-needed food, medicine, and other aid -- a 'drip-feeding' of aid amidst an ocean of desperation," she said.In one of the most revolting acts of inhumanity, hundreds of civilians have been shot down while trying to access food, she pointed out.Gandhi opined that the world has been slow to respond, implicitly legitimising the Israeli actions.The recent moves by several countries to recognise Palestine as a sovereign state are a welcome and long-due departure from the policy of inaction, she said."This is a historical moment and an assertion of the principles of justice, self-determination and human rights. These steps are not merely diplomatic gestures; they are affirmations of the moral responsibility that nations bear in the face of prolonged injustice.It is a reminder that in the modern world, silence is not neutrality, it is complicity," she said.And here, India's voice, once so unwavering in the cause of freedom and human dignity, has remained "conspicuously muted", Gandhi said, hitting out at the Modi government.Meanwhile, it is appalling that just two weeks ago, India not only signed a bilateral investment agreement with Israel, in New Delhi, but also hosted its highly controversial far-right finance minister who has invited global condemnation for his repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian communities in the occupied West Bank, she said.Gandhi argued that India must not approach the issue of Palestine as merely a matter of foreign policy but as a test of India's ethical and civilisational heritage.The people of Palestine have endured decades of displacement, prolonged occupation, settlement expansion, restrictions on movement and repeated assaults on their civil, political and human rights, she said.Their plight echoes the struggles that India faced during the colonial era -- a people deprived of their sovereignty, denied a nationhood, exploited for their resources, and stripped of all rights and security."We owe Palestine a sense of historical empathy in its quest for dignity, and we also owe Palestine the courage to translate that empathy into principled action," she said.

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday successfully conducted a test launch of the intermediate-range Agni-Prime missile from a rail-based mobile launcher system. This marks the first time such a launch has been carried out using a specially designed platform integrated with the national railway network.Defence minister Rajnath Singh confirmed the successful test in a statement on X, calling it a "first-of-its-kind launch" that demonstrates Indias growing strategic deterrence capabilities.The first-of-its-kind launch carried out today from a specially designed rail-based Mobile Launcher has the capability to move on the Rail network without any preconditions, which allows users to have cross-country mobility and launch within a short reaction time with reduced visibility, he said.Also read: India tests its most formidable Agni-5 missile"Congratulations to DRDO, Strategic Forces Command (SFC) and the Armed Forces on the successful test of the Intermediate Range Agni-Prime missile. This successful flight test has put India in the group of select nations having capabilities that have developed a canisterised launch system from a mobile rail network," the post added.The Agni-Prime, a next-generation ballistic missile is capable of striking targets at ranges of up to 2,000 kilometers.The test follows the successful launch of the missile in August at Chandipur, Odisha.In March 2024, a trial of Agni-5 was conducted under Mission Divyastra, showcasing MIRV (multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle) capability. A MIRV-equipped missile can carry 34 nuclear warheads, each aimed at different targets. Currently, the SFC, formed in 2003, operates only single-warhead missiles. The solid-fuelled, three-stage Agni-5 is canister-launched, allowing rapid deployment.

NEW DELHI: Ladakh witnessed its worst violence in decades on Wednesday as a protest over statehood and Sixth Schedule safeguards spiralled into clashes that left four people dead and more than 80 injured, including police personnel. Curfew was imposed in Leh, vehicles were set ablaze, and security forces fired teargas and live rounds to quell the crowds.Climate activist Sonam Wangchuk, who had been on a hunger strike for statehood and constitutional protections, called off his fast as tensions erupted after two fellow hunger strikers collapsed and were hospitalised. Here are ten key points explaining what led to the unrest:The spark: Hunger strike and hospitalisationThe immediate trigger came on Tuesday evening when two hunger strikers, Tsering Angchuk (72) and Tashi Dolma (60), were shifted to hospital in critical condition. They were part of a 35-day fast demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule protections. Their collapse moved youths across Ladakh to take to the streets in solidarity. By Wednesday morning, a shutdown had been called, crowds gathered at Martyrs Ground in Leh, and anger spilled over into clashes. Climate activist Sonam Wangchuk admitted the hospitalisation acted as the flashpoint for the violence that derailed his peaceful campaign.What are the demands?At the heart of the agitation are four demands: statehood for Ladakh, extension of the Sixth Schedule, separate Lok Sabha seats for Leh and Kargil, and employment reservations. Protesters argue that without Sixth Schedule protections, Ladakhs fragile ecosystem, land rights, and cultural identity face severe threats. The Sixth Schedule, currently applicable to tribal areas in the northeast, provides autonomy through elected councils with financial and administrative powers. Activists accuse the BJP of reneging on its 2020 promise to secure this status for Ladakh.Sonam Wangchuk ends his hunger strikeClimate activist Sonam Wangchuk, who began fasting on 10 September, announced an abrupt end to his protest as violence erupted. I request the youth of Ladakh to stop the violence forthwith as it only causes harm to our cause, he said. Calling it the saddest day for Ladakh, Wangchuk admitted that his peaceful path had failed but urged the government to listen to the peoples demands. We will keep our agitation non-violent, he promised, stressing that the aim of his hunger strike was defeated if young lives were lost.Four killed, scores injured in clashesOfficials confirmed that four protesters, aged 19, 20, 23 and 46, were killed in clashes, with at least 80 others injured. More than 40 police personnel were among the wounded. Witnesses said teargas and lathi charges were used before security forces opened live fire when crowds hurled stones and attacked government and BJP offices. Several protesters reportedly lost limbs in the violence. The deaths marked the first fatal clashes in Ladakh since it became a Union Territory in 2019, reviving painful memories of 1989 when three people were killed during protests for UT status.Arson and vandalism across LehAs tensions escalated, groups of youths torched vehicles and vandalised public property. The BJP headquarters and the Hill Council office in Leh were set on fire, along with a police vehicle. Officials described scenes of flames and dark smoke billowing across the town. The police resorted to firing and teargas to disperse crowds, but the violence spread rapidly. Authorities later imposed curfew to prevent further bloodshed, saying the days events represented one of the darkest moments in Ladakhs recent history.Government blames 'provocative statements'The Union home ministry accused politically motivated individuals and provocative statements of fuelling the unrest. In its statement, it urged people not to circulate old or misleading videos on social media and assured that dialogue with Ladakhs groups was continuing. The government stands committed to the aspiration of the people of Ladakh by providing adequate constitutional safeguards, it said. It pointed to ongoing talks with the Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA) through a High-Powered Committee. The next round of talks was already scheduled for October 6, the ministry noted.Lt Governor calls it a conspiracyLt Governor Kavinder Gupta condemned the violence, calling it heart-wrenching and a conspiracy to disturb Ladakhs peace. Everyone has the right to speak in a democratic system, but what happened today was not spontaneous, he said, vowing action against those responsible. Gupta alleged attempts were being made to replicate uprisings in Nepal and Bangladesh and blamed vested interests for inciting violence. He urged Ladakhis, particularly the youth, to restore calm, emphasising that the administration stood with them but would not spare conspirators.Political blame game intensifiesThe clashes quickly turned political. The BJP accused the Congress of fuelling the unrest, claiming the violence was part of a larger conspiracy. Party spokesperson Sambit Patra alleged it was a Congress-led protest disguised as a Gen Z revolution. The Congress, however, blamed the Modi government for mishandling the situation and delaying talks. Congress leader Manish Tewari demanded a forensic examination of how a peaceful protest turned violent. Omar Abdullah said Ladakhs unrest reflected broader discontent with the denial of statehood across Jammu and Kashmir.CentreLadakh talks and frustrationsSince 2019, Ladakhi groups have repeatedly demanded constitutional safeguards. The Leh Apex Body and Kargil Democratic Alliance jointly spearheaded the movement, forcing the Centre to set up a High-Powered Committee in January 2023. Talks, however, stalled after May, when only a domicile policy was finalised. The hunger strike and fresh shutdown were aimed at pressuring the Centre to resume dialogue. With the next meeting set for October 6, activists accused the government of dragging its feet. Wangchuk said frustration among Ladakhs youth grew because the government ignored peaceful appeals for years.What next?With curfew in place and security forces deployed across Leh, the situation remains tense. Authorities fear the death toll may rise, with several injured in critical condition. Reinforcements from the CRPF have been brought in, and Section 163 of BNSS has been invoked to ban rallies without prior approval. Activists insist dialogue must resume urgently to prevent further escalation. We do not want instability in Ladakh and the country, Wangchuk said.

A US official confirmed that a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump was on the cards, ANI reported on Thursday. However, no further details were provided about the probable meet. "I'm sure you'll see the two meet. They have a very, very positive relationship," ANI quoted the official saying.Despite trade and visa tensions with India, Trump has called PM Modi "a good friend" and relationship with New Delhi "very special."Trump also called PM Modi on his 75th birthday appreciating him for doing a "tremendous job.""Just had a wonderful phone call with my friend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi. I wished him a very Happy Birthday! He is doing a tremendous job. Narendra: Thank you for your support on ending the War between Russia and Ukraine!" Trump had said.Earlier this week, external affairs minister S Jaishankar met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio where the two "agreed on the importance of sustained engagement to progress on priority areas."PM Modi met Trump in February when the two leaders held bilateral talks on trade, energy, and defence cooperation.Recent US-India tensions stem from Trumps 50% tariffs on Indian imports, including a 25% levy tied to Russian oil, and a new H-1B visa fee of $100,000 that could impact Indian IT professionals and startups. Despite these issues, both countries are pursuing trade talks as the deadline looms.
