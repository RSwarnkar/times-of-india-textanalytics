Qatari authorities have formalised a new policy granting shorter working hours to female government employees who are mothers or are raising Qatari children. The decision, which follows a successful pilot program, is aimed at improving work-life balance and offering targeted support during key academic periods.Greater flexibility for working mothers in QatarOn Tuesday, September 23, 2025, the Council of Ministers approved a proposal introduced by the Civil Service and Government Development Bureau. The initiative grants eligible female employees in government positions the right to leave work two hours earlier than the official end of the working day during specific academic periods.This adjustment specifically applies to Qatari women and mothers of Qatari children employed in government entities. It is designed to support families, especially during critical school-related periods such as:Mid-academic year breaksMid-term exams for both first and second semestersMid-year and end-of-year examinationsThe reduced hours will help mothers better support their children during demanding academic times, reinforcing Qatars broader strategy of aligning workplace policies with family needs.Backed by policy and pilot successThe decision was based on the success of an earlier pilot program aimed at evaluating the impact of flexible working arrangements. It was formally adopted during the Cabinets 28th meeting of the year and is now codified through Circular No. (6) of 2025, issued by the President of the Civil Service and Government Development Bureau.This policy is part of Qatars ongoing efforts to modernise workplace practices, promote gender inclusion, and strengthen the presence of women in the public sector while upholding their family responsibilities.Scope and limitations of the new working hoursWhile the reduced working hours offer welcome relief for many, the Bureau has clarified that the policy does not apply universally across all government jobs. Female employees working in roles where continuous operations are essentialsuch as those in critical services or where the nature of duties demands full-day coverageare exempt from the early departure provision.This exemption ensures that public service delivery is not disrupted while still allowing flexibility where operationally feasible.A step forward in Qatars family centric reformsThe new policy aligns with Qatar's broader framework to enhance the quality of family life, particularly for women navigating both professional and domestic responsibilities. By embedding flexibility into government roles during high-pressure academic periods, Qatar continues to shape a work culture that is responsive to the needs of its citizens, especially working mothers.

In response to growing public concern over the rising cost of private education in Dubai, the Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA) has unveiled a new strategy aimed at reducing tuition fees and making quality education more accessible. Announced at a high-level leadership forum, the strategy proposes targeted incentives for socially-driven investors, government-backed support, and reforms in cost structures  all designed to balance affordability with excellence across the emirates expanding education sector.A response to growing public pressure The initiative was formally announced by Aisha Abdulla Miran, Director General of KHDA, during the Mohammed bin Rashid Leadership Forum 2025 at the Dubai World Trade Centre. Addressing an audience of decision-makers and stakeholders, Miran acknowledged the persistent and growing concerns voiced by families, particularly on social media, over the escalating cost of education.Education is not mentioned without mentioning the high cost of schools, she said, adding that she had personally received messages, including one from a foreign parent who said she had spent Dh1 million on her childrens schooling in Dubai. This sentiment, Miran explained, directly shaped KHDAs new educational strategy, which focuses on delivering good education at reasonable prices, and aims to restructure the economics of school development and operations.Socially-driven investment and government incentives Central to KHDAs plan is a proposed policy, currently being prepared for presentation to the Dubai Executive Council  that will encourage investment from entities whose primary motives are social impact rather than profitability.We are working on a policy that will be presented to the Executive Council, the essence of which is to create incentives for a certain type of investors whose main goal is not profitability but other social objectives, Miran explained. To support such investors, the strategy proposes several key government incentives:  Subsidised land rents   Reduced land prices   Operational cost reductions through better urban planning   Support for teacher housing and staff welfare   This shift in focus is expected to attract a new class of educational operators to Dubai  those willing to offer high-quality education without charging premium fees, enabled by reduced overheads and access to state-backed infrastructure support.Building a sustainable, affordable education ecosystem KHDAs new approach goes beyond individual school fees. It calls for a holistic ecosystem that addresses multiple cost-driving factors in the education sector, from land and infrastructure to teacher housing and operational sustainability. Miran noted that urban planning would play a significant role in this transformation:Linking urban planning with land distribution and with it the requirements in terms of school components, as well as investment costs in the sector and operational costs and educational staff by providing housing at reasonable prices  this is an aspect we are working on. The KHDA will also review cost structures across private schools to determine where operational or managerial changes can be made to bring down expenses without compromising quality. Subsidised teacher housing is also being explored as a way to retain high-calibre staff without inflating school budgets.We aim through these initiatives to continue to reduce the cost of education and maintain high quality at the same time  to make Dubai a destination in the education sector on both regional and global levels, said Miran.Ambitious goals for growth and global appeal The affordability initiative is one part of Dubais broader Education 33 Strategy, under which the emirate aims to open at least 100 new private schools by 2033. Fifteen have already launched in the past two years, and over 20 more applications are currently under review by KHDA. The emirate now has:  227 private schools   387,441 enrolled students   Students from 185 nationalities   12% increase in enrolment for 2023202   Projected 6% increase in the following year   The overarching aim, according to Miran, is for Dubai to become a global education hub. This includes not just expanding the number of schools, but attracting international students and world-class educational programs.We work with some entities in terms of providing housing at reasonable prices and health insurance because it affects competitiveness in attracting international students, she explained. Our ambition is to attract 50 per cent of international students in the region. While the goal is lofty, Miran emphasized that success would depend on cross-sector collaboration:There are plans that need solidarity and integration from different entities.Current fees and regulation According to The National, private school tuition in Dubai remains among the highest in the region. Fees can exceed Dh100,000 per year for high school students at top-tier institutions. For example:  Kings School Al Barsha: Dh57,999 (FS1), Dh105,873 (Year 13)   Brighton College Abu Dhabi: Dh50,830 (Nursery), Dh80,780 (Year 13)   In May 2025, KHDA approved a tuition fee increase of up to 2.35% for the 20252026 academic year, based on its education cost index, which factors in staff wages, support services, and rental expenses. However, only schools operating for more than three years are eligible for this adjustment, and all applications undergo KHDA review.

Charlie Kirk assassination suspect Tyler Robinson's transgender boyfriend was reportedly kicked out of the parents' home during the latter years of high school over their Mormon faith.Lance Twiggs, 22, bounced between homes during his latter years of high school after clashing with his family over their beliefs in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, New York Post reported. Twiggs was expelled from his home after distancing himself from the family's religious doctrines and reportedly experimenting with drugs and alcohol during his youth. He sought refuge with two friends, brothers from a large, blended family comprising six biological children and three adoptees, according to their sister, Braylon Nielsen, who spoke to The Post on Wednesday. While the brothers are now estranged from the family, the 19-year-old remembers Twiggs fondly, noting that they took him in during his junior year in 2021, despite the family's limited knowledge of the troubled high schooler. It was on and off. He was bouncing couches. He would live with us for a few months, but didnt like taking up our couch. He would crash with friends, she explained. I loved Lance. His parents kicked him out of his house, and he lived with us. His parents never sat right with my family, Nielsen added. She further commented that his parents appeared overbearing in their religious zeal and dismissed family members' claims as spiteful gossip. Lance, that I know of, has never done drugs. He was always like, I dont want to go out and party. He just wasnt a big partier, she said. Despite the tensions, Nielsen praised Twiggs as a hardworking and straight A student who ensured inclusivity during his time at UT Success Academy, an accelerated programme for gifted students pursuing college-level courses. We went to a dance once, a high school dance, and he was very involved with it. Made sure everyone had rides. Made sure everyone had clothes. He just took care of people. My sisters car broke down once, and he came out to help her, she added. Ben Kaufman, Executive Director of UT Success Academy, did not have direct interactions with Twiggs, who graduated around the time Kaufman began working at the school. However, Kaufman stated, Everything Ive heard about him, he was a great kid. He was nice. He worked hard. Despite being open about his issues, Nielsen revealed she was unaware that Twiggs was transgender. She defended Twiggs, asserting he had no involvement in Robinsons plan. I think thats all Tyler. The Lance that I knew would never do something like that. I could never see Lance doing that, she insisted. Nielsens mother, Jackie, also maintains that Twiggs is innocent in the assassination plot against Kirk, hoping he finds peace post-investigation. I dont believe Lance would have any part of that. Hes a good kid. Hes a kid. Hes compassionate. He minds his own business. I hope the world lightens up on him and stops being so hateful until they have all the facts. He doesnt deserve this, she told The Post. Twiggs recently left the townhouse he shared with Robinson, who was similarly raised as a devout Mormon, in St George, Utah. Washington County Sheriff Nate Brooksby previously stated that Twiggs was in a safe space very far away from St George, and needed to lay low for a long time. He has not been charged with any crime in connection with Kirks assassination and is reportedly cooperating with authorities.

A Paris court on Thursday convicted former French president Nicolas Sarkozy of criminal conspiracy, while acquitting him of corruption and illegal campaign financing in the trial over allegations that late Libyan dictator Moamer Kadhafi helped fund his successful 2007 presidential campaign.The trial adds to a series of legal troubles for the 70-year-old right-wing ex-leader, who denies all charges.Judge Nathalie Gavarino stated that Sarkozy, as a serving minister and party leader at the time, had allowed his close collaborators and political supporters over whom he had authority and who acted in his name, to approach the Libyan authorities in order to obtain or attempt to obtain financial support.However, the court did not accept prosecutors argument that Sarkozy was the direct beneficiary of the illegal campaign funds. He was acquitted of separate charges, including embezzlement of Libyan public funds, passive corruption, and illegal financing of an electoral campaign.Two former close aides were also convicted: former right-hand man Claude Gueant was found guilty of passive corruption and falsification, while former minister Brice Hortefeux was convicted of criminal conspiracy. Eric Woerth, Sarkozys 2007 campaign treasurer, was acquitted.In a dramatic twist, the ruling came just two days after the death in Beirut of Franco-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine, a key accuser who had claimed multiple times that he delivered up to five million euros ($6 million) in cash from Kadhafi to Sarkozy and his chief of staff in 20062007. Takieddine had later retracted his claims, only to contradict his retraction, prompting another investigation into Sarkozy and Bruni-Sarkozy on suspicion of pressuring a witness.Prosecutors maintained that Sarkozy and his aides struck a pact with Kadhafi in 2005 to illegally fund his victorious 2007 campaign. Investigators say Kadhafi was promised help in restoring his international image following Libyas alleged role in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing and a 1989 attack over Niger. Kadhafi was ultimately overthrown and killed during the 2011 Arab Spring, after NATO imposed a no-fly zone with France under Sarkozy playing a key role.The prosecution relied on statements from seven former Libyan officials, trips to Libya by Gueant and Hortefeux, financial transfers, and the notebooks of former Libyan oil minister Shukri Ghanem, who drowned in the Danube in 2012.Sarkozy has faced a series of legal battles since leaving office, including convictions for graft and illegal campaign financing in the Bygmalion affair, for which he served part of his one-year jail term with an electronic tag before conditional release. He has appealed those verdicts. He also lost the Legion of Honour, Frances highest distinction, following the graft conviction.Despite these legal challenges, Sarkozy, once known as the hyper-president", retains considerable influence and popularity on the right of French politics and continues to meet regularly with President Emmanuel Macron.

TAIPEI: A Taiwan court handed jail terms Thursday ranging from four to ten years to four people, including a former staffer in President Lai Ching-te's office, for spying for China.The four people were charged in June, a month after they were expelled from Lai's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates for Taiwan's sovereignty, over suspected espionage.China claims democratic self-ruled Taiwan is part of its territory and has threatened to use force to annex it. Taipei accuses Beijing of using espionage and infiltration to weaken its defences.The Taipei District Court said in a statement the four were convicted of violating the Classified National Security Information Protection Act for leaking state secrets to China. "The information they spied on, collected, leaked and delivered involved important diplomatic intelligence... which made our country's difficult diplomatic situation even worse," the court said.The espionage happened "over a very long period of time," including sharing itineraries of high-level officials such as the foreign minister, which "endangers the country's diplomatic security and is highly condemnable".The heftiest ten-year sentence is for Huang Chu-jung, who previously worked for a New Taipei City councillor.According to the statement, Huang mixed public information with "secrets and confidential information" he received from Ho Jen-chieh, an aide to then foreign minister Joseph Wu, to write analysis reports and "sent to Chinese agents using encrypted software".Ho was sentenced to eight years and two months in prison.Huang and another defendant Chiu Shih-yuan, who received a jail sentence of six years and two months, were also convicted of laundering around NT$7.2 million (US$236,600) in illicit gains.The fourth defendant Wu Shang-yu, who had worked for Lai when he was vice president and then president, received a four-year prison term.Beijing and Taipei have been spying on each other for decades, but experts say the threat to Taiwan is greater given the risk of a Chinese invasion.Taiwan's national security bureau said previously 64 people were prosecuted for Chinese espionage last year, with prison sentences reaching as high as 20 years.

Donald Trumps UN attack on London and Sadiq Khan revived an old charge  that Britains capital is sliding into sharia law. The claim is false as a matter of law, but it draws force from genuine controversies in London: religious councils that disadvantage women, free speech curtailed in the name of public order, and Britains catastrophic mishandling of grooming gangs.Driving the newsSpeaking at the UN General Assembly, Trump accused London of wanting to go to sharia law under its terrible mayor Sadiq Khan. Almost simultaneously, the Daily Mail published a long report branding London the Sharia capital of the West, highlighting Islamic councils issuing fatwas, discriminatory divorce practices, and a case where a Quran-burning protester was slashed on the street while his attacker was spared jail.Also Read: Your countries are going to hell: Trump blasts Europes migration at UNGA; accuses London mayor of seeking Sharia law'Trumps claim is legally baseless: English law remains supreme. But it resonates because it amplifies very real failures and contradictions in Britains handling of religion, justice, and integration.Sharia councils  de jure vs de factoOrigins and scale. The first Islamic Sharia Council opened in Leyton in 1982. Today there are at least five in London, and perhaps dozens more informal bodies across the UK. A 2017 review estimated 85 nationwide, with London, Birmingham, Bradford and Dewsbury as hubs.Function. These councils deal with marriage, divorce, inheritance, and financial disputes. They have no power over criminal law. But in practice, many Muslims turn to them first, giving them social authority that far outweighs their legal standing.Discrimination. Reports to Parliament and NGOs document councils denying women equal divorce rights, asking wives to pay husbands to secure release, or pressuring women into mediation that leaves them at a disadvantage. Because many Islamic marriages arent registered civilly, women often cannot access English family courts. The result is a shadow system that traps women in abusive marriages.Free speech and the charge of back-door blasphemyThe Quran-burning case exposed a glaring tension:The protester. Hamit Coskun set fire to a Quran outside the Turkish consulate, shouting anti-Islam slogans. He was convicted of a public-order offence on grounds of hostility towards Muslims.The attacker. A Muslim man slashed Coskun with a knife but received only a suspended sentence. Judges insisted they were following sentencing guidelines, but the perception was unmistakable: blasphemy was punished more harshly than violence.The reaction. Secularists warned this amounted to reinstating blasphemy laws through the back door. They argued that offensive expression, however distasteful, must be tolerated, while violence must never be excused. The Starmer controversy. The issue returned to Parliament in late 2024, when Labour MP Tahir Ali asked Keir Starmer if the government would legislate against desecration of religious texts and prophets of Abrahamic faiths. Starmer condemned the act as awful but stopped short of ruling out new laws, framing it instead as part of tackling hatred. Secular groups warned that this was a fresh attempt to smuggle in blasphemy protections, years after the UK had abolished them. For critics, Labour looked once again like it was pandering to religious sensitivities at the expense of free expression.Fatwas and English courtsConcerns escalated when a High Court judge in the Tafida Raqeeb case mentioned the benefit of a fatwa while allowing parents to seek further treatment for their brain-damaged child. The ruling made clear that English law was decisive, but even citing a fatwa gave the impression that religious rulings were creeping into secular judgments.Grooming gangs  the scandal behind the rhetoricTrumps sharia London claim gains traction because it taps into Britains failure to confront group-based child sexual exploitation:The scandal. In towns like Rotherham, Rochdale and Telford, thousands of girls were abused over decades. Many perpetrators were Pakistani-heritage men, often working in groups.Institutional cowardice. Authorities ignored victims for years, fearing that acknowledging the ethnic pattern would be branded racist. This allowed abuse to flourish unchecked.Political fallout. The far right seized on the scandals as proof of Muslim exceptionalism. The left was accused of denial. Communities were left mistrustful of police and councils.National inquiry. In 2025, Keir Starmer finally announced a statutory nationwide inquiry  a recognition that piecemeal reports had failed. But decades of neglect had already cemented the impression that Britain bent its institutions to avoid offending minorities.This history is the fuel behind Trumps rhetoric. When he says sharia law, he is exploiting the memory of grooming gangs  a real British failure  and spinning it into a narrative of London as a city already lost.Trump vs Khan  a personal feud on a global stageTrump and Khan have been at each others throats for nearly a decade. Khan opposed Trumps travel ban; Trump called him a stone cold loser. For Trump, Khan is the perfect foil: a Muslim mayor of a global city, liberal, pro-immigration, pro-diversity. By linking Khan to sharia law, Trump casts him not just as a political opponent but as a symbol of Western weakness.So, is London the Sharia capital?Legally: No. UK law governs London. Sharia councils have no binding authority.Practically: Yes, sharia councils exert influence in family and community disputes, and their practices often disadvantage women. Combined with lenient treatment of religious vigilantism and decades of institutional silence on grooming gangs, London does appear to operate with double standards.Politically: The Sharia capital label is a caricature. But it gains traction because it exaggerates genuine problems Britain has failed to solve.London is not under sharia law. But it is a city where informal tribunals disadvantage women, where courts have blurred the line between public order and blasphemy, and where authorities failed catastrophically to protect vulnerable girls. Trumps rhetoric is crude, but it draws power from these unresolved failures, which the UK hasnt recognised in the first place.

Between January and July 2025, Kuwait witnessed a significant number of divorces among its citizens, with detailed statistics revealing new patterns in family dynamics. Despite these rising divorce figures, marriage rates remain robust. In response, the Ministry of Justice has implemented improved mediation strategies aimed at preserving family cohesion and addressing underlying social challenges.Divorce trends in Kuwait: Rising cases and new patternsNew data from Kuwaits Ministry of Justice highlights 222 cases of khula (divorce initiated by wives) recorded between January 1 and July 31, 2025. Notably, 287 Kuwaiti women divorced before consummation of their marriages in the same period, outnumbering those who divorced after cohabitation. This suggests a shift in marital dissolution patterns, where many separations occur early on, even before couples fully start married life.Additionally, 439 cases involved Kuwaiti husbands divorcing one wife while remaining married to one or more other wives, reflecting complexities in polygamous family structures that still exist in the country.Marriage and divorce numbers: Contrasting realities in KuwaitDespite the rising divorce figures, marriage rates among Kuwaitis remain strong. The Ministry of Justice reports a total of 5,993 marriages between Kuwaiti nationals in the first seven months of 2025. Over 75% of these marriages involved Kuwaiti citizens on both sides, underscoring the continued social importance of marriage in Kuwaiti society.However, divorces are not limited to recent marriages. The statistics reveal a total of 2,666 divorces during 2025 involving couples married in previous years. This indicates that many dissolutions happen after longer periods of marriage, pointing to challenges that affect families over time rather than only during the initial stages.Ministry of Justice steps up family support and prevention effortsIn response to these developments, a responsible source at the Ministry of Justice confirmed the recent adoption of an enhanced framework aimed at reducing divorce rates. Central to this effort is the strengthening of marital reconciliation centers across Kuwait.These centers now operate with a multidisciplinary team comprising sociologists, family counselors, and religious scholars who actively engage with couples to mediate disputes before they escalate into divorce. Their role is to provide guidance, conflict resolution, and counseling tailored to the social and cultural context of Kuwaiti families.Raising awareness and inter agency cooperation in KuwaitBeyond mediation, the Ministry emphasizes broad inter-agency collaboration to educate newly married couples about critical social risks. A key focus is raising awareness about the impact of drug abuse on families, a factor increasingly recognized for its potential to destabilize marriages and harm children.Officials also highlight the importance of informing couples about the social and psychological consequences of divorce, aiming to promote healthier family dynamics and reduce the strain on individuals and society.

HONG KONG: A weakened Tropical Cyclone Ragasa pushed west along the southern Chinese coast towards Vietnam on Thursday after flooding streets and homes in the economic hub of Guangdong province and causing deaths in Taiwan and the Philippines earlier in the week. In the Guangdong city of Yangjiang, over 10,000 trees were damaged and branches floated in submerged streets. Crews used excavators to clear toppled trees and worked to clear blocked roads, Yangjiang Daily reported. Nearly half a million households suffered power outages and more than a third of those homes remained without electricity Thursday morning, the newspaper reported. Streets in the city of Zhuhai turned into rivers and rescuers used inflatable boats to rescue stranded residents. Water inundated the ground floors of homes in older neighborhoods, Southern Metropolis Daily reported. Communication with people on some islands in Jiangmen city were cut off, Southern Weekly newspaper said.  To the west in the Guangxi region, schools and businesses were closed and tourism activities halted in some cities.  More than 2 million people were relocated across Guangdong ahead of Ragasa, which peaked at super-typhoon strength on Monday with maximum sustained winds of 265 kph (165 mph) and the world's strongest cyclone of the year.  By Thursday afternoon, its sustained winds had weakened to a maximum 55 kph (34 mph) and Ragasa, downgraded to a tropical depression, was forecast to dissipate eventually while remaining a rain threat for Vietnam and other parts of Southeast Asia.  Vietnam's Prime Minister Phm Minh Chinh ordered government ministries and local authorities to protect infrastructure like dams and hospitals, secure fishing vessels and coastal assets, and ready evacuation and, search and rescue operations. Some flights were canceled or rescheduled, and workers trimmed trees to avoid wind hazards in the northern part of the country.  For Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, activities halted earlier in the week were gradually returning to normal.  Flights in Hong Kong resumed after some 1,000 had been disrupted, affecting about 140,000 passengers. Businesses reopened Thursday. But some big fallen branches remained scattered on the streets after more than 1,200 trees across the city were topped by the fierce winds. Some 100 injured people were sent to the hospital.  In Taiwan, authorities on Thursday revised the death toll from 17 to 14, citing double-counting. The victims were in eastern Hualien county, where heavy rain caused a barrier lake to overflow, sending water gushing into nearby Guangfu township. Muddy torrents destroyed a bridge, turning the roads in the township into churning rivers that carried vehicles and furniture away. Some people remained out of contact in Hualien, and dozens were injured across the island. During a visit to the county, Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te expressed condolences over the loss of lives, saying the government would do its utmost to help Hualien return to normal life. In the Philippines, Ragasa left at least 11 dead, including seven fishermen who drowned Monday when their boat overturned in northern Cagayan province. Two fishermen remained missing Thursday. Another tropical storm was approaching the Philippines from the Pacific. The storm, which was named Opong in the country and Bualoi elsewhere, was forecast to hit the east-central Philippines on Friday and could still strengthen into a typhoon. It had sustained winds of up to 110 kph (68 mph) and higher gusts, government forecasters said.

Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, recently took to social media with a candid and cryptic confession that has sparked debate among fans and critics alike. In his tweet, Musk wrote: Sometimes I say things so stupid that people think theyre profound. And sometimes I say things so profound that people think theyre stupid. The post reflects Musks characteristic mix of humour, introspection, and controversy, highlighting the fine line between genius and nonsense in the eyes of the public. Social media users reacted with a mix of admiration, confusion, and criticism, questioning whether this is a deep philosophical reflection or typical Musk-style trolling. The post also raised the perennial question of whether this was really Musk or a parody account.Elon Musks tweet sparks mixed reactions and viral buzzMusks tweet immediately went viral, generating a mixture of admiration, confusion, and scepticism. Some users related it to a similar Musk reflection: Sometimes when I do good things, people think I'm a bad guy. Sometimes when I do bad things, people think I'm very good. Others praised his insight, noting: That is the beauty of perspective, wisdom and nonsense often wear the same mask. The difference is in who is listening, not always in what is said. Fans and critics debated whether the post was a profound realisation or simply typical Musk eccentricity. Many even questioned whether the tweet came from the real Musk or a parody account, highlighting the uncertainty his social media presence often generates.The tweet underscores a recurring theme in Musks public persona, which is the blurred line between brilliance and eccentricity. Over the years, his statements on topics from artificial intelligence to Mars colonisation have often divided opinion. Musks unconventional style makes it difficult to separate genuine insight from provocative commentary, a trait that continues to define his social media presence.Given Musks history of inspiring both genuine and satirical posts online, some users questioned the authenticity of the tweet. Parody accounts mimicking his voice are common, making it necessary to verify sources. In this case, the tweet was confirmed to be from Musks verified account, confirming that the enigmatic statement was indeed his own.The value of perspectiveMusks statement highlights how perception can vary greatly from person to person. What seems nonsensical to one might appear insightful to another. It reflects the unpredictability of his communication style, which provokes discussion, keeps followers guessing, and reinforces his status as a polarising figure in both technology and popular culture.

Dubai has approved a 100-year deep-tunnel drainage system following last years record rainfall. The announcement came at the Mohammed bin Rashid Leadership Forum 2025 at Dubai World Trade Centre, under the patronage of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. The forum, attended by 1,000 government and private sector leaders, highlighted the deep-tunnel systems role in protecting the city and boosting resilience.Storms spur actionDubais extraordinary rainfall in April 2024, which overwhelmed existing drainage networks, became the catalyst for immediate infrastructure reforms. Roads flooded, commutes stalled, and city systems were stretched, highlighting vulnerabilities in stormwater management. According to Khaleej Times, the city acted swiftly, approving a comprehensive deep-tunnel drainage project designed to serve Dubai for the next 100 years.Speaking at the Mohammed bin Rashid Leadership Forum 2025, Dubai Municipalitys Acting Director General, Eng. Marwan Bin Ghalita, described the storm as a blessing that accelerated long-planned improvements. He emphasised the collaborative spirit that emerged during the crisis:The first benefit for me is the collaboration of all parties as one team, and the message that no entity is to blame for anything; we are one team that must solve this crisis.Dubais 100-year drainage planThe initiative forms part of the Tasreef programme, Dubais AED 30 billion long-term stormwater development plan, which aims to extend drainage coverage across the emirate by 2033. The programme will increase capacity by 700%, managing over 20 million cubic metres of water per day, while reducing construction and operating costs for pumping stations by 20%. Implementation includes designing and constructing deep tunnel infrastructure with a maximum flow rate of four cubic metres per second. Previous phases enhanced groundwater and stormwater systems in areas such as Al Maktoum City, Expo City, and the Airport District.Strategic partnerships and smart technologyDubai Municipality has partnered with Dubai South in an AED 150 million agreement to build a secondary stormwater tunnel connecting the districts network to the deep-tunnel system via Expo Road. This connection will improve surface runoff management, reduce flooding risks, and protect roads, buildings, and public assets.In addition to building physical infrastructure, Dubai Municipality is leveraging sophisticated Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to boost the citys readiness for extreme weather. By running detailed simulations, the team has identified high-risk zones, allowing for faster, more targeted responses when floods or storms strike. Bin Ghalita highlighted the importance of technology in crisis management:The most important benefit we need to build on is the integration of systems in databases because when a crisis happens, you need data from everywhere. Today, we are working on establishing the infrastructure, as we mentioned, for drainage and tunnels, as well as a robust database that provides clear data, enabling you to make quick decisions. The project relies heavily on public-private partnerships, reflecting Dubais appeal as a global collaborator. Bin Ghalita noted,The beautiful thing about this is our partnership with the private sector. Today, Dubai as a brand is something everyone wants to work with; every global company wants to collaborate with you, and the project has started implementation.Preparing Dubai for the future The deep-tunnel drainage system and the broader Tasreef programme align with Dubai Economic Agenda D33, ensuring the citys infrastructure meets international standards and keeps pace with population growth. By integrating advanced planning, GIS mapping, and robust data systems, Dubai aims to transform its stormwater management into a model of efficiency and resilience. With the combination of cutting-edge technology, strategic partnerships, and large-scale construction, the project promises a safer, more sustainable urban environment, ensuring that Dubai is prepared for extreme weather events for the next century.

The Atlantic Ocean may witness one of meteorologys rarest and most intriguing phenomena this week as Tropical Storm Humberto and a nearby developing system, Invest 94L, move closer together. These storms could interact through the Fujiwhara Effect, a complex dynamic where two cyclonic systems orbit around a shared center. While more common in the western Pacific, this effect occasionally occurs in the Atlantic, last seen in 2023 with Tropical Storms Philippe and Rina. Such interactions can dramatically affect storm trajectories, intensities, wind speeds, and landfall possibilities, significantly complicating forecasts. The Fujiwhara Effect can result in one storm dominating, merging with the other, or creating unpredictable rotations, making it a key focus for meteorologists and vulnerable coastal communities.Understanding Fujiwhara Effect: The rare storm interactions and their impactThe Fujiwhara Effect is a meteorological phenomenon that occurs when two cyclones or hurricanes spinning in the same direction come within roughly 900 miles of each other. Upon reaching this proximity, the storms begin to orbit a shared central point, creating a dancing motion. This movement is not a simple rotation; each storm circulates around the midpoint, much like two ice skaters holding hands and spinning in a synchronized pattern.Typically, the stronger storm dominates, pulling the weaker system into its circulation, potentially absorbing it entirely. In rarer cases, storms of nearly equal strength can merge, forming a single, more powerful cyclone. This effect was first observed and documented in the 1920s by Dr. Sakuhei Fujiwhara, a Japanese meteorologist who studied interactions of vortices in water and their implications for larger atmospheric systems.Why the Fujiwhara Effect is rare in the AtlanticThe Fujiwhara Effect is more commonly observed in the western Pacific due to the higher frequency of cyclones forming in close proximity. In the Atlantic, simultaneous storms close enough to interact are less frequent, which is why such occurrences are notable. The last recorded Atlantic Fujiwhara event took place in September 2023, when Tropical Storms Philippe and Rina briefly engaged in a complex orbital pattern before one storm overtook the other.The rarity of this effect in the Atlantic adds a layer of unpredictability to hurricane season forecasting. When two storms interact, standard models may struggle to accurately predict track, intensity, and potential landfall, making early warnings and continuous monitoring essential.Humberto and 94L storms showing unpredictable movement from Fujiwhara EffectCurrently, Tropical Storm Humberto (formerly known as Invest 93L) is moving west-northwest across the Atlantic with sustained winds of 40 mph. Forecasts suggest Humberto could strengthen into a hurricane by the weekend. Meanwhile, Invest 94L, which is likely to become Tropical Storm Imelda, is developing nearby.Meteorologists are particularly focused on these two systems because the potential Fujiwhara interaction could dramatically alter 94Ls path. While Humberto is expected to remain mostly offshore, its gravitational influence on 94L could either push it toward land or deflect it, significantly affecting risk zones along the US East Coast. This interdependence highlights how unpredictable tropical storm behavior can become when multiple systems are involved.How the Fujiwhara Effect alters storm dynamicsWhen storms enter a Fujiwhara interaction, they rotate around a shared center rather than simply around each other. The outcomes of this interaction can vary:The stronger storm dominates, absorbing the weaker storms circulation.The weaker storm orbits the stronger one, potentially altering its path or intensity.In rare cases, two similar-strength storms merge, creating a single, more powerful cyclone.These dynamics complicate forecasting models, as standard prediction tools struggle to account for the rotational and merging behaviors of interacting systems. Satellite imagery, historical storm analysis, and advanced computer modeling are crucial to track these interactions and anticipate possible landfall scenarios.Historical examples of the Fujiwhara EffectSeveral notable cases demonstrate the effects of storm interaction:In 1974, Hurricanes Ione and Kirsten in the eastern Pacific orbited each other, exemplifying the classic Fujiwhara dance.In the Atlantic, Philippe and Rina (2023) briefly engaged in orbital motion before one storm absorbed the other.These examples underscore the unpredictable nature of the Fujiwhara Effect and its ability to significantly influence storm behavior, including paths, intensities, and potential impacts on coastal regions.Forecast outlook and potential impactsMeteorologists note that both Humberto (Invest 93L) and Invest 94L (Imelda) have a high likelihood of developing further in the coming days. While Humberto may largely remain at sea, 94L could bring heavy rainfall, strong winds, and potential flooding to the Southeast or Mid-Atlantic US coasts.Even if 94L stays offshore, atmospheric conditions may channel moisture inland, creating flash flood risks in areas such as the Carolinas, southern Appalachians, and parts of the Mid-Atlantic starting this weekend. Due to the potential Fujiwhara interaction, tracking these systems closely is critical. Small shifts in position or intensity could dramatically change which regions are affected, highlighting the need for constant monitoring from the National Hurricane Center and local authorities.Implications for residents and communitiesThe Fujiwhara Effect is not just a meteorological curiosity; it has real-world implications for safety and preparedness:Coastal residents should remain vigilant for sudden changes in storm forecasts.Emergency agencies must consider multiple scenarios for landfall, flooding, and wind impacts.Awareness and preparedness plans are essential given the unpredictable nature of interacting storms.The potential interaction between Humberto and Invest 94L serves as a reminder of how complex and dynamic tropical storm behavior can be, particularly when multiple systems form close to each other.Also Read | H-1B visa hike alert: $100K fee could drive top IIT graduates away from US startups; warns Yale scholar

What do we know about the airport security disruptions?A cyberattack Friday has caused significant disruption to a number of European airports, most notably Berlin, Brussels and London Heathrow.The European Union's cybersecurity agency, ENISA, said on Monday that a third-party ransomware attack targeted check-in and boarding systems on a widely-used software known as MUSE, operated by US company Collins Aerospace.Brussels airport canceled half of its flights on Sunday, and there were cancellations and delays in Berlin and London with the effects still being felt on Monday. Professor Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert from the University of Surrey in England, told DW that this may not be the end of it."People will accept delays, but they want to be kept informed. One of the things that frustrates people is sitting in an airport not knowing what on earth is going on. Is this going to affect flights in two, three, four days?"What problems are the airport cyberattacks causing?While Collins said that delays to check in and baggage drop "can be mitigated with manual check-in operations," the widespread cancellations show the knock-on effects of staff having to manually write out baggage tags and perform checks usually done online. It also highlights the reliance of major global infrastructure on IT systems that can be compromised.Woodward said some firms underinvest in IT, adding there is legitimate concern that other airports may yet be targeted in this attack. "If it was a ransomware attack, why were only three airports affected?" he said. Collins' services are used in more than 150 airports worldwide.For Woodward, who advised the EU's police agency Europol and has worked for the UK government on such matters, the answer may be that those affected were the ones who installed a compromised update on Friday or, more troublingly, that the attackers are using those breaches we know about as leverage."This could now be a case of Collins trying to get out a version they can be sure is clean of any malicious software," he said. "Or it could be the attackers are still in some central system that everybody uses and they're trying to extort Collins by saying: 'There was our proof of concept. We took three major airports out. If you don't pay us money, it's going to spread.'"What is the latest?All the airports involved are still impacted to some degree. A BBC report on Monday said an internal memo to Heathrow staff outlined that more than 1,000 computers may have been "corrupted" and most of the work to bring them back online has to be done in person and not remotely. In Brussels, 140 of Sunday's 276 scheduled outbound flights were binned while Berlin Airport's website still warned Monday of "longer waiting times" due to an "outage at a service provider."The same report claims that a system reboot by Collins was not sufficient to resolve the issue, with hackers still found in the system, adding weight to Woodward's theory. Collins are still referring to a "cyber incident" rather than an attack, and say they are updating their systems.Who might be behind the airport ransomware attacks?There has been very little official information so far, particularly on who may be targeting Collins and, by extension, the airports.Woodward, the cybersecurity expert, said it's possible that "the usual suspects" of countries, like China, Iran and North Korea could potentially be behind such an attack, possibly utilising criminal gangs as proxies. But one stands out. "If there is a nation state behind this, then they're playing fast and loose and being very aggressive. And the ones that normally do that, and have the capability, are Russia."Woodward stressed that, without any official information, this was somewhat speculative and that "it could be a group of teenagers in their bedrooms for all we know."Given the major disruption to people's lives, he called for greater transparency from those companies involved. "Are they silent because they don't know, and they're desperately trying to find out? After 72 hours, are they still none the wiser as to what's happened? That would be almost more worrying." What might be the economic impacts of airport cyberattacks?In the immediate term, there will be financial hits for the airports and the airlines in the form of refunds, compensation, reductions in footfall and reduced payments to airlines from airports due to the reduced service.Longer term, there may be more serious issues for Collins, owned by the American RTX corporation, which makes weapons and aircraft engines as well as dealing in cybersecurity. "Everybody's going to be looking at Collins for recompense. That could end up in a horrible court case about who's actually responsible for this," said Woodward.It is unclear at this point whether any personal data has been breached in the attack. If it has, added Woodward, that could be more serious still. "Ransomware attacks tend to not just gum up the works, but they also steal the data and take it away. So even if you repair your system, they say, 'Well, we've still got your data, but we're holding that to ransom.'"Fines for breaches of GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) are levied by individual countries and can be huge. In 2023, Meta, the company that owns Facebook, was fined a record 1.2 billion ($1.4 billion) by Ireland's Data Protection Commission for a breach of GDPR regulations and also paid out vast sums in other countries.

Less than four months after being elected, South Korean President Lee Jae-Myung has announced an ambitious campaign to reform the constitution in way which would allow future presidents to serve two consecutive four-year terms instead of stepping down after a single five-year stint.The initiative is at the top of the administration's 123-item policy agenda. Proponents say the reform would also synchronise presidential elections with votes for members of the National Assembly in order to encourage continuity of policies and greater responsibility while in office.Analysts, however, point out that pushing through constitutional changes in South Korea requires a two-thirds parliamentary majority and that the opposition is likely to frustrate Lee's plans.Presidents out of sync with lawmakers"When the present constitution was written in 1987, the biggest controversy was over how to elect the president," said Lee Sang-sin, a research fellow specialising in political science at the Korea Institute for National Unification.Pre-1987, South Korean president would be elected by the representatives in the National Assembly. The 1987 reform then switched the vote to the public election and enforced a limit of a single five-year term."The problem was that members elected to the National Assembly have four-year terms, meaning that elections for the president and the assembly are constantly out of sync," Lee Sang-sin told DW, adding that this would lead to political instability, divided administrations and failed policies.South Korea to get run-off presidential voteWhile announcing the latest reform proposal, the government officials did not specify if the changes would allow current President Lee Jae-myung to run again after his term expires in 2030. Last week, however, officials clarified that the two-term system would only go into effect after the center-left leader is out of office.The amendment would also change the way that presidential elections are conducted. The current system only requires a single round of voting, and the candidate with the biggest share of the votes is named president even if they don't secure an absolute majority of over 50%. Under the proposed reform, however, South Korea would introduce a run-off round between the two top candidates.Lee's administration also plans to make other alterations to the constitution, including updating the wording of passages on the rights of sexual minorities and the government's position with regards to North Korea.Same-sex marriages and North Korea likely to trigger resistanceThe ruling party is around six seats short of the two-thirds majority it requires to pass the legislation. Even if Lee managed to secure enough votes in the assembly, the changes would then need to be approved by a simple majority in a national referendum, which gives his rivals from the conservative People Power Party a degree of influence."Many presidents from both the conservative and progressive sides of Korean politics have been in favor of changing the system to allow a president to serve two terms, but I still think it will be difficult for Lee's Democratic Party to push this through because the opposition will resist," political scientist Lee told DW."Some of the other things that Lee wants to change in the constitution, particularly around same-sex marriages, human rights issues, and how we treat North Korea, are going to be strongly opposed by the conservatives in the National Assembly," he added.Kim Sang-woo, a former politician with the left-leaning South Korean Congress for New Politics and now a member of the board of the Kim Dae-jung Peace Foundation, said urgent reforms need to be made beyond the two term system."The intention is to align voting for the president with voting for the National Assembly, but at the same time to make it the same as in the United States," he told DW.The proposed changes should "give a serving government greater time to prove itself and to demonstrate its policies before the voters have to make a decision on whether to re-elect it or to kick it out."Democracy still 'vulnerable'It is worth noting, however, that many politicians in South Korea campaigned on similar reforms in the past, but were not able to see them through. This also includes previous presidents Kim Dae-ju and Park Geun-hye.Talking to the Le Monde newspaper, Duyeon Kim of the Center for a New American Security think tank warned that "South Korea's democracy remains vulnerable.""Imprecise laws invite amateur interpretations," she was quoted as saying to the French paper."A fierce ideological divide colors even the most obvious flaws in existing democratic institutions and practices," the expert added, noting that both conservative and progressive governments "have exhibited a penchant for authoritarian practices."Additionally, South Korea's big business and even its prosecutors office tend to resist any reforms that may jeopardise their influence.Majority of South Koreans back reformFormer politician Kim from the Kim Dae-jung Peace Foundation also noted that the current system is criticised for concentrating virtually all power in the hands of the presidential office.The proposed reforms would "fundamentally alter" how power is distributed within government, spreading both power and responsibility to individual ministers and bureaucrats in government ministries."The aim is to make ministers and their staffs take decisions on their own initiative instead of constantly looking over their shoulder for direction from the president's office," Kim said."Instead of just following orders, they need to really push their ideas and the project that they are passionate about."The former politician is more optimistic that Lee will be able to convince others to support his constitutional reform."Polls have indicated that more than 60% of the Korean public is in favor of these changes," he said. "They need to be comprehensive and not just give a president the possibility of two terms. The really important thing is greater delegation of power and responsibility."

Infections caused by drug-resistant nightmare bacteria are rising rapidly in the United States, with cases increasing nearly 70 percent between 2019 and 2023, according to scientists at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The findings, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, warn of the growing threat from bacteria carrying the so-called NDM gene, which are resistant to many frontline treatments.What the CDC report foundResearchers analysed data from 29 US states that test and report cases of carbapenem-resistant bacteria. They counted 4,341 carbapenem-resistant infections in 2023, including 1,831 cases linked to bacteria carrying the NDM (New Delhi metallo--lactamase) gene.The rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023, marking a 69 percent increase. In comparison, the rate of NDM-related cases surged more than fivefold, from about 0.25 to 1.35 per 100,000 people.The rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome, David Weiss, an infectious diseases researcher at Emory University, told the Associated Press in an email.CDC scientists noted that actual numbers are likely higher because many hospitals lack the capacity to test for genetic resistance, and several large states  including California, Florida, New York, and Texas  did not submit complete data.What are nightmare bacteria?The CDC uses the term nightmare bacteria to describe pathogens that resist a wide range of antibiotics, including carbapenems, often considered drugs of last resort for severe infections.Bacteria carrying the NDM gene are particularly dangerous because they produce an enzyme that breaks down carbapenems, rendering them ineffective. Only two intravenous antibiotics are currently effective against these strains, both of which are costly and difficult to administer.Originally, NDM-carrying bacteria were identified mainly in patients who had received medical care overseas, making them relatively rare in the US. But the recent surge suggests wider community spread and a growing domestic threat.How bacteria become drug-resistantDrug resistance develops when microbes adapt to survive medicines designed to kill them. According to CDC researchers, misuse and overuse of antibiotics is a key driver.Incomplete prescriptions, unnecessary use of antibiotics for non-bacterial illnesses, and widespread availability of drugs without proper oversight all contribute to the problem. Resistant bacteria not only survive but can also share their resistant genes with other microbes, making infections harder to treat.Dr Maroya Walters, one of the CDC reports authors, explained that community spread could make even routine infections more serious. That may play out in doctors offices across the country, as infections long considered routine  like urinary tract infections  could become harder to treat, Walters said.The pandemic connectionSome experts suggest the COVID-19 pandemic may have accelerated drug resistance.We know that there was a huge surge in antibiotic use during the pandemic, so this likely is reflected in increasing drug resistance, Dr Jason Burnham, a researcher at Washington University, told the Associated Press.Burnham added that the CDCs figures underestimate the true scale of the problem because testing remains inconsistent across the country.Early signs of infectionCarbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections are difficult to distinguish from common bacterial illnesses, which can delay diagnosis and treatment. Some of the early signs include:Urinary tract infections (UTIs): frequent urination, pain or burning sensation, cloudy urineBloodstream infections: high fever, rapid heartbeat, very low blood pressurePneumonia (lung infection): persistent cough, chest pain, shortness of breathBecause these symptoms overlap with less dangerous infections, specialised testing is required to confirm resistance.Global spread of NDM-carrying bacteriaThe problem of antibiotic resistance is not confined to the US. Experts stress that because bacteria spread easily between people, animals, and food chains, the threat is global.South Asia: NDM-producing bacteria are relatively common, particularly in India and Pakistan. Contributing factors include overcrowded hospitals, high antibiotic use, and weak regulation of generic drugs.Europe: Southern European nations such as Greece, Italy, and Turkiye report higher rates of resistant bacteria than northern Europe, where infection control measures are stricter.Africa: Data remains limited, but studies suggest resistant bacteria are present in both hospitals and communities. Weak sanitation and unregulated antibiotic use heighten the risk.Latin America: Countries such as Brazil and Argentina have reported outbreaks of carbapenem-resistant infections, especially in 2021 and 2022.Researchers note that countries with weaker health systems or looser restrictions on antibiotic sales are more vulnerable to rapid spread.Why this mattersDrug-resistant infections are a major public health concern because they reduce the effectiveness of antibiotics that underpin modern medicine. Surgeries, cancer treatments, and routine procedures rely on antibiotics to prevent or treat infections.The CDC has repeatedly warned that without effective action, resistant bacteria could roll back decades of medical progress. The rise of NDM-related infections in the US adds urgency to the challenge.The CDC memo concludes that stronger surveillance, better infection control, and careful stewardship of existing antibiotics are essential. Expanded testing across states, international cooperation, and the development of new drugs are also needed to prevent wider outbreaks.For now, the scale of the threat remains uncertain. As Burnham noted, the absolute number of US infections is definitely underestimated.

A FlyDubai flight en route from Dubai to Tel Aviv made an unscheduled emergency landing in Riyadh on September 24, 2025, after an Israeli passenger suffered a stroke mid-air. The incident prompted swift cooperation between FlyDubais crew and Saudi authorities, marking a rare but efficient diversion despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel.In flight medical emergency triggers diversion to SaudiFlyDubai flight FZ-180 departed from Dubai at 4:17 PM local time on its scheduled route to Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv, carrying around 80 passengers, including over 50 Israeli nationals. Midway through the journey, one of the passengersan Israeli nationalsuffered a stroke, prompting the crew to declare a medical emergency. According to ANI.Upon assessing the gravity of the situation, the flight crew immediately contacted Saudi Arabian air traffic control. Given the urgent need for medical attention, the aircraft received special clearance to land at King Khalid International Airport (RUH) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabiaapproximately the midway point between Dubai and Tel Aviv.Emergency landing and medical response in RiyadhFlyDubai flight FZ-180 landed at Riyadhs King Khalid International Airport at approximately 5:45 PM local time, where emergency responders were on standby. The affected passenger, an Israeli national, was promptly transferred to a local hospital for urgent medical treatment.While the passenger received care, the remaining approximately 80 passengers were asked to remain onboard the aircraft. According to reports from Ynet News, passengers described waiting on the tarmac for more than three hours, during which limited information was provided by the crew. One passenger, Rom Gedasi, shared that the delay felt unusually long and unclear. Another passenger, identified only as Miri, said the atmosphere onboard remained calm, despite passengers concerns about the emergency landing in Saudi Arabia.Diplomatic coordination and airline acknowledgmentWhile Saudi Arabia and Israel do not maintain formal diplomatic relations, the incident demonstrated the ability of both nations to collaborate on humanitarian and aviation safety grounds. Saudi officials acted in accordance with international aviation conventions, as noted by Israels Foreign Ministry, and authorized the emergency landing without hesitation.FlyDubai issued a public statement thanking Saudi air traffic controllers, emergency medical responders, and airport officials for their professionalism and cooperation. The airline also praised its flight crew and operational teams, highlighting their swift decision-making and passenger care during the crisis.

On the grounds of Paderborn Airport, engineer Michael Spengler demonstrates how far self-driving technology has come in Germany. He enters a route into his smartphone, taps a button and rests his hands in his lap. The small car begins to roll, navigating at a leisurely 7 kilometers per hour (4 mph) between buildings and parked vehicles."It can go faster  20 to 25 kilometers per hour is no problem," the researcher from Augsburg University of Applied Sciences said while sitting in the driver's seat, only as a safeguard, he explained, ready to take over if something goes wrong.Cameras, radar, so-called Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors and a high-performance computer keep the car on course. After a short loop, the vehicle brakes on its own at the destination, where a crowd waits to also get a first taste of autonomous driving.The event was organised by NeMo (New Mobility) Paderborn, a coalition of 75 partners from academia and industry. Like several other consortia across the country, it hopes to help Germany claim a leadership role in the technology.But the challenges are steep in Germany. High car ownership, a strong taxi lobby and a well-developed public transit network leave little room for newcomers to the mobility market. Many projects have fizzled out once government funding dried up.The energy-efficient swarmGermany has authorised Level 4 autonomy, which allows passengers to sleep, work or watch movies while traveling, provided vehicles operate on preapproved routes or under remote supervision.But according to the German motorists' association ADAC, progress is slow partly because it is absolutely unthinkable for German manufacturers to go into series production with an immature system.And so, while driverless taxis are already a common sight in parts of the United States and China, German deployments remain limited to shuttles and minibuses on fixed, local routes.Several German towns and cities like Munich and Monheim are testing autonomous driving, and even though not a single accident has happened with such a car, conventional car drivers have reportedly been annoyed by their overly cautious driving style.NeMo wants to change that. Its concept involves a "swarm" of lightweight autonomous cabs handling short trips and first-and-last-mile connections. For longer distances, the cars can couple automatically to an autonomous tractor unit, forming a convoy before separating near their destinations.In late August, the first cabs were allowed to drive autonomously on airport grounds. The larger tractor vehicle is still under development, with the first commercial rollout expected in Paderborn by 2026.Energy efficiency is the project's calling card. The cabs, designed for up to four passengers, are half the weight of a conventional car and carry only small batteries, limiting their range.To compensate, the tractor unit will "recharge them on the move, powered by its own battery, hydrogen tank and fuel cell," said Thomas Trster of Paderborn University, adding that traveling in the tractor unit's slipstream also reduces the cabs' energy consumption."We're not retrofitting existing cars for autonomy; we're building entirely new vehicles," Trster told DW.Rural mobility reimaginedMunich startup INYO is supplying the autonomous cars, while HOLON  a spinoff of German auto supplier Benteler  is developing the tractor units.The service is designed to be cheaper than a taxi but not much more expensive than going by bus. "It depends on whether passengers are willing to accept waiting times, have luggage and whether they accept others joining during the ride," said Trster. For example, a woman might want to book a vehicle for herself alone at night for an extra fee.NeMo describes the model as "individualised public transit", especially suited to rural areas where buses are infrequent.Etteln, a village near Paderborn, is among them. In 2024, it was named the "world's smartest" by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the world's largest professional association for technical professionals in electrical and electronic engineering.Speaking with DW, Etteln's mayor, Ulrich Ahle, said the community has been running a so-called e-village car service for five years, in which people can book rides via smartphone. A service for residents without a driver's license would be the "next logical step," he said, adding that the Etteln had already created a 3D digital twin of the village, where the autonomous cabs have begun driving virtually.From pilots to mainstreamElsewhere, Germany's biggest city experiments are moving faster. In Hamburg, transit operator Hochbahn is deploying about 20 autonomous vehicles in partnership with HOLON and Volkswagen subsidiary MOIA. The fleet will include minibuses for up to 15 passengers and Volkswagen (VW) electric cars for smaller groups.Initially, safety drivers will be present, but the vehicles will operate without fixed routes or schedules. Test users will be able to book rides via an app within a densely populated 37-square-kilometer zone.The Association of German Transport Companies (VDV) predicts the first regular Level 4 services could launch within five years. The vehicles are technically mature and legally permitted.But it cautions that autonomous driving won't solve Germany's traffic and land-use problems if it simply replaces the country's 48 million private cars one-for-one. Instead, driverless fleets must be integrated into the public transit system, and scaling up will not come cheap. So, rather than continuing to finance temporary pilot projects, the industry group wants the German government to support a nationwide rollout. Only then, it argues, can the government live up to its pledge to become a global leader in autonomous mobility.

This week marks the 80th anniversary of the the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), and world leaders have gathered in New York for the occasion. But amid mounting geopolitical tensions, rising climate change and increased challenges to the global rules-based order, the mood is not exactly celebratory.Instead, it would appear that the United Nations is being challenged like never before.One major reason is the split in the Security Council over Israel's war in Gaza and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Its peacekeeping missions have also drawn criticism, particularly in Africa. And last year, a group of climate policy experts, including former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and the prominent climate scientist Johan Rockstrom, called the COP climate summits "no longer fit for purpose."But Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stresses the importance of the United Nations to tackle global issues. "No country can stop a pandemic alone. No army can halt rising temperatures," he said on Tuesday while addressing the UN General Assembly.What, exactly, is the UN General Assembly?One of the six principal organs constituting the United Nations, the UNGA is the main representative body, offering space to deliberate policies and pass recommendations through resolutions. UNGA resolutions are, in effect, merely statements of intent, expressing an internationally agreed-upon position. They are generally not enforceable by law."We have no carrots and no sticks," Guterres admitted as he was speaking to the challenges the UN faces to make a practical difference in security terms. "And, as we have no carrots and no sticks in a world in which we have the geopolitical divides that we have, it's extremely difficult to make the protagonists of the present conflicts understand the need to come to peace." Can the UN really help bring peace?The Security Council (UNSC) is considered the main global body for preserving international peace and security, but has long faced criticism for its limited composition, which frequently leads to key members blocking resolutions.It is made up of five permanent members: The UK, US, Russia, China and France all of which are nuclear powers. There are also 10 non-permanent members, elected every two years on a rotational system based on region.Crucially, the five permanent members have the power to veto a decision unilaterally. In contrast, seven of the 10 non-permanent UNSC members must reject a resolution to prevent it from passing. This power has consistently been used by veto-holding powers to promote their own interests, such as when the US blocked resolutions demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza or Russia blocked resolutions condemning the war in Ukraine. Critics say the Security Council is outdated and unrepresentative. This is particularly true for Africa and South America, which have no permanent representative on the Security Council.Daniel Forti, a senior UN analyst at the International Crisis Group think tank, told DW that reform is hard to come by because the "permanent five members are reluctant to agree on any changes that would dilute their influence." "Few would suggest that the Security Council is functioning well right now," he continued. "Geopolitical clashes between the US, China and Russia have made it all but impossible for the Council to respond to the world's worst conflicts over the past decade. This has seriously dented the Council's and by extension, the UN's credibility."Do US withdrawals leave the UN struggling for funding?The UN is funded in the first instance by contributions from its member states, in the form of mandatory donations based on a country's size and wealth and voluntary contributions, usually from more wealthy countries.Though the United States still contributes to the organization, Donald Trump's decision to sign a slew of executive orders withdrawing from several UN institutions and programs, including the World Health Organization (WHO), has left the organization in some financial difficulty.Earlier this month, Guterres proposed a cut of $500 million (425 million) to the UN budget next year, equivalent to about 15% of its core budget, down from $3.7 billion to $3.2 billion. Initiatives like the World Food Programme ($9.7-billion budget), the UNHCR programme for refugees ($10.7 billion) and the WHO ($6.8 billion) cost even more and also face financial uncertainty."The aid cuts and freezes that Washington has put into place are forcing the organization into a period of considerable retrenchment," Forti said. "No other country is stepping up to fill all of the funding gaps left behind. This means that the UN will need to make very difficult cuts, not only within the system but also in the support it provides people around the world. This means less vaccination campaigns, less education initiatives, and less support for refugee resettlement.Can the UN reform and become more relevant?Calls for reform to the UN have existed for almost as long as the organization, but are growing louder and more widespread. Irish President Michael D. Higgins called for the UN to be "remodeled for the future, giving agency to Africa, Asia and Latin America" last year.In February, Trump said: "I've always felt that the UN has tremendous potential. It's not living up to that potential right now." He doubled down on the claim at the General Assembly this week.Forti also sees a need, but also the potential, for change. "The organization can reform. But it will be a bumpy road along the way. Serious reform will take time and will likely be a painful exercise for countries that rely on the UN for support," he said."Getting the UN to its next era will require a clear vision of reform from the next secretary-general, and considerable diplomatic backing from many UN members. The organization has survived turbulent periods at other points in its history. Doing so again will require countries to make a strong case for why the UN matters to their people," he added.
