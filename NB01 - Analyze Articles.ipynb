She flew as a mission specialist and medical officer on the SpaceX Polaris Dawn mission in 2024, setting a new female altitude record. Menon brings firsthand spaceflight experience and expertise in biomedical systems critical to astronaut health.Historic milestones and unique achievements of the latest announcementThis astronaut class is notable for several reasons. Menon becomes the first person in NASAs astronaut corps with prior orbital experience, having flown aboard SpaceXs Polaris Dawn mission last year. She will also join her husband, Anil Menon, a former SpaceX employee selected in the 2021 astronaut class. This selection marks the first time women outnumber men in a NASA astronaut class, highlighting the agencys push for gender diversity in space exploration.The 10 astronauts will undergo two years of intensive training, including geology, water survival, space health, and high-performance jet exercises. Training prepares them for assignments on the International Space Station (ISS), as well as future Artemis missions to the moon and potential crewed missions to Mars. While NASA is winding down ISS operations by the early 2030s, lessons learned aboard the station will serve as preparation for deeper space exploration.The path to the moon and MarsNASA has already selected experienced astronauts for upcoming Artemis missions, including Artemis II, which will orbit the moon next year. The newly selected class could become eligible for later Artemis flights, including lunar landings and possibly missions to Mars, where no human has yet traveled. These astronauts represent the next generation of explorers who will carry forward NASAs goals of long-term lunar presence and interplanetary exploration.\", \"date_published\": \"2025-09-23T13:26:00+05:30\", \"comments\": [], \"detected_language\": \"English\", \"comments_sentiment\": [], \"key_phrases\": [\"Johnson Space Center\", \"newest class\", \"astronaut candidates\", \"NASA\", \"Monday\", \"Houston\"], \"named_entiry_recognition\": [{\"entity_name\": \"NASA\", \"entity_type\": \"Organization\"}, {\"entity_name\": \"Monday\", \"entity_type\": \"DateTime\"}, {\"entity_name\": \"astron\", \"entity_type\": \"Product\"}], \"linked_entities\": [{\"entity_name\": \"NASA\", \"entity_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA\"}, {\"entity_name\": \"Monday\", \"entity_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday\"}]}\n"
